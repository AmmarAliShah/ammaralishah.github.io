  <h1 class="post-title">Blogging Depression</h1>
  <span class="post-date">05 Mar 2016</span>
  <p>I have’t been able to post anything lately even though I wanted to.</p>

<p>At first it was because I was running into problems with Jekyll ( more on this <a href="https://medium.com/@ammarshah/why-is-my-blog-inactive-jekyll-problems-24b325e1bd26#.np9ykrjnb">here</a> ), but more recently due to depression - blogging depression.</p>

<p>During the period of time when I couldn’t post, I went through the blog. It was really disappointing. This was not the blog I had envisioned. I started this blog, with the intention of it being my brain on the web but it has turned into a pile of excuses for not posting and no relevant content whatsoever. This didn’t feel like my blog.</p>

<p><strong>This was not my blog</strong>, at least not the one I wanted it to be.</p>

<p>It’s my fault really. I thought this blog could be anything but I was wrong. If this blog tries to be everything, it will turn into nothing, like it did.</p>

<p>This blog felt wrong to me as I read it back. I constantly thought what is this blog even about. The best thing I could come up with was that this was an excuse blog. You get an excuse with every post.</p>

<p>The most this blog ever got to what I wanted it to be was during my <a href="/2015/12/12/isl-trip/">winter trip to Islamabad</a> a few months ago. That was just me writing about my day, what I did. Writing those posts were fun. It was as if I was inviting the reader to explore with me. That was what I wanted this blog to be. No, not a travel blog, but my brain. This blog is a digital representation of me. So far, it portrays me as a messed up person who makes too many excuses.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, I got really sick of this blog. <strong>I hated my own blog!</strong> I couldn’t get myself to post.</p>

<p>So, it was time to make changes.</p>

<p>The first thing I did, was open up Google Docs and layed out my blogging plan. I wrote about all the things I want to write about and distributed them to blogs according to their topic. One thing I straight out got of it was that I need <em>at least</em> one more blog for my code life.</p>

<p>I wasted no time in creating a new blog, “<a href="http://ammarcodes.blogspot.com/">Ammar Codes</a>”. So far I’ve made 3 posts on that blog. If you ever read my blog for the code/tech stuff, you should go there.</p>

<p>That left behind this blog - <em>what was I going to post on this blog?</em></p>

<p>I really wanted this blog to be a representation of me. I love reading, watching movies/shows, food, travelling and a lot of other things. That was all a part of my life, so there was my answer, I turned this blog into a lifestyle blog.</p>

<p>Now what exactly does that mean? Well it means that this blog is going to be a mix or reviews, recommendations and travel logs. I’ll also be posting the occasional thoughts on a matter. So in short, if it’s happening in my life it’s on my blog.</p>

<p>I’m sure over time I’ll turn this into the blog I had originally planned. To ensure that, I’ve actually made a few rules.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No stock imagery</strong>. I’m going to use images I took/own or I won’t use them at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No schedule</strong>. I’m not going to burden myself into posting regularly. I might post once a month or 3 times in a week. This way, I won’t have to excuse myself for not posting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No click bait</strong>. This is serious. I don’t want to use click bait headlines to get people to read.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m also dropping the blog name. The blog doesn’t need a name. If it’s representing me, it will bear the same name as me. This transaction will take place once I shift my blog over to WordPress and buy the domain.</p>

<p>Well that’s all for now, best of luck to all of you!</p>
