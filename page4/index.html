I hope I&#39;ll do better...<br>

    So I recently quit CS50x and in that post I stated I&#39;d be writing about my progress every week till the end of the year. Well it&#39;s Sunday and my time is up and as stated, this is y first weekly report. This week wasn&#39;t as productive as I thought it would be due to some family events. I had to spend three complete days away from my house and computer(Wednesday, Friday and Sunday) so...<br>
