    I’ve always had a weird relationship with coffee. As soon as I finish a cup, I’m going to get sleepy - really sleepy! I won’t be able to keep my eyes open and if I lie down, I’ll fall asleep. It has the exact opposite effect on me, but, around an hour later, It’ll work it’s magic - I’ll be wide awake, unable to sleep. I had Coffee around 9PM. As soon as I gulped...<br>

    I have’t been able to post anything lately even though I wanted to. At first it was because I was running into problems with Jekyll ( more on this here ), but more recently due to depression - blogging depression. During the period of time when I couldn’t post, I went through the blog. It was really disappointing. This was not the blog I had envisioned. I started this blog, with the intention of it...<br>

    Yes you read that correctly - an Android app by Microsoft. The app is an alarm clock! What’s special about this particular clock is that it does not just let you cancel your alarm - You have to play a game to turn it off! The way it works is that when your alarm goes off, you are given two options you can swipe too - swipe left for snooze and swipe right to cancel....<br>

    It’s 2016! It’s a new year, which means new goals, new things to focus on. Last year, I left CS50. This year, I plan on ending what I started. What’s CS50x? According to the site, CS50 is: Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how...<br>

    Look at the calendar. Look at the clock. It’s 2016! 2015 is behind us and now 2016 is where we stand. The page has turned and has given us yet another year to improve our lives and the lives of others around us. If you have nothing else to be grateful for, just be grateful that you have been given the chance to live another day. Let’s take a look back on 2015: A look...<br>
