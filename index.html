<em>Picture by <a href="https://instagram.com/huzefa_mustafa/">Huzefa Mustafa</a></em></p>

<p>The time has come for me to admit my crimes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t been loyal to this blog and to the people who read it. In my <a href="http://ammaralishah.me/2015/07/10/so-it-begins.html">very first post</a>, I promised I would fall into some kind of regularity of blogging after I start High School. A few weeks after that, when <a href="http://ammaralishah.me/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x.html">I quit CS50</a>, I made yet another promise that I would post about my code journey every week. I haven&#39;t been able to fulfill either of those promises :-(</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Phew!</em> Good thing I got that off my chest, I can sleep peacefully now. Am I done here then? Not quite... being the nice guy I am, I&#39;m going to tell you exactly why I haven&#39;t been able to keep my promises, or in-other-words, I&#39;m going to play the blame game :))</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR I blame my High School</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="http://ammaralishah.me/2015/07/10/so-it-begins.html">mentioned before</a>, I started High School in the second week of August and had to adjust to my new schedule. Turns out, It&#39;s practically impossible to do so. I leave for school at around 7 AM and return around 4 PM. By the time I change, shower and eat, It&#39;s already over 5 PM. By the time I&#39;m back to functioning properly, it&#39;s over 7 PM and I have to start doing my homework which take two hours(yes they are trying to kill us). By 10 PM, I&#39;m exhausted and just fall asleep. That&#39;s my routine Monday through Friday. Hopefully this will earn me your sympathy and you&#39;ll let me go for not keeping my promise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR  I found better ways to track my progress while being productive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve laid out the practical impossibility of a blogging routine, I&#39;m going to tell you about my weekends. Judging from my daily schedule, you might argue that I had time to write my weekly report on weekends, and you&#39;re absolutely right. I could have written the weekly report, but I didn&#39;t. At first, I forgot writing it every Sunday night and later on, I realized it was just another burden on me. I only had two free days every week and I could either be productive or worry about everything else I have to do. So I just made rough notes of what I did that day and decided to turn them into real posts later on(which I never did). <strong>So I&#39;ve just decided to quit writing my weekly report</strong>. The only reason I was writing them was to track my progress right, well FCC, GitHub and other tools I use are already doing that!</p>

<p>FreeCodeCamp does a great job of tracking my daily progress so I don&#39;t need to track it myself,</p>

<p><img src="/../assets/FCC.JPG" alt="FreeCodeCamp progress"></p>

<p>and so does GitHub.</p>

<p><img src="/../assets/GHprog.JPG" alt="GitHub tracking"></p>

<p>That frees me of the responsibly to track my progress and I can focus more on learning to code.</p>

<p>By now, I expect you warm-hearted people have forgiven me for not keeping my word and sympathies with me and my class fellows and are going to spam <a href="http://commecscollege.edu.pk/">my school</a> about the horrific timings. If that is the case, here&#39;s <a href="mailto:info@commecscollege.edu.pk">their email</a>.</p>

<p>So basically this posts <em>officially</em> announces my previous promises are now no longer valid. To make it up for that, I&#39;m going to make new promises :))</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m going to go through the backlog of this blog and I&#39;m going to update/edit all of my posts</li>
<li>I&#39;m going to try to blog more often about things that I want to write about(I said I&#39;ll try)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want me to stay true to my word, you might wanna bug my school so much that they shorten our timings. It&#39;s almost 11 AM so I&#39;m gonna go and eat breakfast. <a href="mailto:info@commecscollege.edu.pk">Spam my school</a>!</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I read chapter 0 of <a href="http://diveintohtml5.info/">Dive into HTML5</a></p></li>

    <p>It&#39;s been 2 weeks since I took my <a href="e-learning/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x.html">JavaScript pledge</a> and it&#39;s Sunday night which means time for my weekly report. This week wasn&#39;t productive at all and I did even worse than <a href="/code/2015/08/02/js-pledge-week1.html">last time</a>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I read Chapter 5 of Eloquent JavaScript</p></li>
<li><p>I read Learn HTML &amp; CSS by Shay Howe</p></li>
<li><p>I built a practice website(HTML &amp; CSS)</p></li>
<li><p>Solved the &quot;reverse an array&quot; challenge</p></li>

    <p>So I recently <a href="/e-learning/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x.html">quit CS50x</a> and in that post I stated I&#39;d be writing about my progress every week till the end of the year. Well it&#39;s Sunday and my time is up and as stated, this is y first weekly report. This week wasn&#39;t as productive as I thought it would be due to some family events. I had to spend three complete days away from my house and computer(Wednesday, Friday and Sunday) so that put me a little behind on my progress.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I completed <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-learn-regular-expressions">Free Code Camp Waypoint: Learn regular expressions</a></p></li>
<li><p>I read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html">chapter 4</a> from <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">Eloquent JavaScript</a></p></li>
<li><p>Completed &quot;<a href="https://github.com/AmmarAliShah/EloquentJavaScript-Solutions/blob/master/04_01.%20The%20sum%20of%20a%20range.js">The sum of a range</a>&quot; exercise from <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net">Eloquent JavaScript</a></p></li>

<li><p>Completed <a href="/cert.jpg?raw=true">Build Your First Website: Getting Started with HTML &amp; CSS</a> at <a href="http://www.sitepoint.com/">Sitepoint</a></p></li>
</ul>

<p>That&#39;s all for this week. I know it&#39;s not much but I&#39;ll try improving next week. The whole point of this pledge is to track my progress and try to improve little by little every week.</p>

        Why I quit Harvard CS50
      </a>

<blockquote>
<p>After a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50/permalink/562182657262117/">long debate</a>, this post has been updated with more details</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few weeks ago, as mentioned in my <a href="/updates/2015/07/10/so-it-begins.html">previous post</a>, I started Harvards famous Computer Science MOOC, <a href="http://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a>, on <a href="%22https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">edx</a>. Now by the time you&#39;ll reach Week 1, you&#39;ll know why this course is so famous - Hint: It&#39;s the teacher. <a href="https://twitter.com/davidjmalan">David</a> is the reason for CS50s success. He&#39;s very energetic and easily steals the attention of his audience. He is the second <em>teacher</em> who has inspired me, the first one being, <a href="http://simonallardice.com/">Simon Allardice</a>. Now back to CS50.</p>

<p>I joined CS50</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Below is the previous post if you wanna read it</p>

<p><strike>
<p>
In my <a href="/updates/2015/07/10/so-it-begins.html">previous post</a>, I mentioned I started <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">Harvards CS50</a> on edx. Today, I decided to quit it and I un-enrolled from the class on edx. I made the decision after thinking on it long and hard so I&#39;m not regretting what I did. Here&#39;s why I quit:
</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
To sum it up in a line, <em>I didn&#39;t have time for it</em>. I&#39;m a web developer meaning what I do is related to the web - websites and web-apps. The course teaches C, a language not built for the web. My main focus was learning full-stack JavaScript and not C. When I started the course, I thought I would be able to do complete it without interference to my commitment to <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a>, which is to start the non-profit projects before the end of 2015! Sadly enough, in the past month, I haven&#39;t made much progress there either. CS50x was not in any way my reason for not being able to keep my commitment to freecodecamp, I just got distracted.
</p>
So today, I decided to remove all other distractions from my JavaScript learning path and focus on learning JavaScript. For the rest of they year, I&#39;m going to learn and practice JavaScript only. I won&#39;t play with any other language such as C or Python.
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>
So there&#39;s a few things I&#39;ll be doing to keep focused on JavaScript:
<ul>
<li> I&#39;m going to read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a></li>
<li> I&#39;m going to complete at least one <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a> challenge every day</li>
<li> Every week, i.e every Sunday night, I&#39;ll be posting about my progress of the previous week.</li><br>
</ul>
This is it. By the end of this year, I&#39;ll have made good progress if everything goes as planned :)

        So it begins

    <span class="post-date">10 Jul 2015</span>

    <p><img src="/../assets/hello-world.png" alt="Hello World"></p>

<p>I&#39;m growing tired of this! <em>This?</em> Writing this, <code>Hello world</code> post. This is the third time I&#39;m writing this and this time I decided to change the title - much better, don&#39;t you think?</p>

<h2>Why did you write it thrice?</h2>

<p>Since I discovered blogging in 2012, I&#39;ve set up several blogs on various topics, and have deleted or <a href="https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199">lost them</a>. I used <a href="https://www.blogger.com">Google Blogger</a> for my first few blogs and then over the years, used many other solutions such as <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, <a href="http://modx.com/">MODX</a>, <a href="https://www.lightcms.com/">LightCMS</a>, and a lot more. Each blog had a life span of a few months. Here I&#39;m only going to talk about the personal blogs I had/have setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I wrote the first one titled <code>Ello World</code> back when I started my personal blog in early 2015 but sadly, <a href="https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199">I lost it!</a>. My first blog was based on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and hosted for free at <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/690150.html">000WebHost</a>. The problem with this setup was that it was ad-supported and on every refresh or load an ad popped up which was annoying!  </p></li>
<li><p>My second blog, sadly never made it to the internet. I set it up a few weeks ago, using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and it was hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. Now Ghost isn&#39;t natively supported on GitHub pages, as it only allows static sites and Ghost is based on <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. So, I found <a href="http://leftofnull.com/2014/02/07/using-github-pages-with-ghost-and-buster-on-windows-part-1/index.html">this post</a>, that used a set of tools to let you run Ghost on GitHub pages. Following the instructions, I successfully set up Ghost on my local machine and configured it. That is when I wrote, this post for the second time, titled <code>Ello World...Again</code>. I ran into a problem with Buster with that setup and after numerous tries I couldn&#39;t fix it. I contacted the author of the post through Twitter, and I even commented on the post, but after a little back and fro, I gave up! I even got a Tweet from someone telling me the CSS on my site was broken - something I didn&#39;t notice. So I decided to try something else.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">@AmmarAliShahK</a> I think your CSS is broken on your website <a href="http://t.co/bXAJwIDRpm">http://t.co/bXAJwIDRpm</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Harames (@MatthewHarames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewHarames/status/617758469584654336">July 5, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></li>
<li><p>This brings us to my third and current state, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll, is built by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the same company whose service I was using to host my site so I thought you can&#39;t get more compatible than that, right? So I started with Jekyll and ran into problems with the final site again. So I explored other popular static site generators from the list at <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>. After trying out around a dozen other options and facing the same problem, I concluded I was doing something wrong. So I Googled around, and after a little playing around with Jekyll(actually a lot playing around), I finally nailed it!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now I plan on sticking with this for a while. I don&#39;t know for sure right now, but I will re-design the site in the future, but right now, I don&#39;t have the time or the energy to do so.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m still working through <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp</a></li>
<li>I started <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info">Harvard CS50x</a> on edx</li>
<li>I gave <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/chinese-language-learn-basic-mandarin-mandarinx-mx101x">learning Mandarin</a> a try but I bailed out after just one day!</li>
<li>I got a haircut :-D</li>
</ul>

<h2>And?</h2>

<p>And that&#39;s it. I plan on blogging regularly but I can&#39;t say for sure right now. My college starts from August and I&#39;m gonna try to fit blogging into my routine. I&#39;m working on a <em>non-profit</em> project atm(not from <a href="http://freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp</a>) and I&#39;ll be writing about that in an upcoming post/posts.</p>
