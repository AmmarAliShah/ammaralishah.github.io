    Today was Day 13 of my trip - the final day! I wasn&#39;t able to post the last two days because my laptop messed up. Here&#39;s what happened: Windows 10 messed up! My system wouldn&#39;t boot! I sat down to write about my day but windows 10 wasn&#39;t agreeing with me. I tried again and again, but after an hour, I decided to go to bed and write in the morning. If you follow me...<br>

    Today was Day 10 of my trip. I wasn&#39;t able to write yesterday so this post will cover that too! So Day 9 &amp; 10 were spent in Sheikhabad. This was my second visit to Sheikhabad for this trip. The first one was a bit short. This trip was a bit longer than the last one. We stayed there for almost two days. This time it rained too! I did a bit of exploring this...<br>

    Today was Day 8 of my trip. We went to Havelian, to visit my cousin. While my family sat in their house sipping tea and talking, I set out with my cousin to explore Havelian. I took a walk around the place. I was pleasantly surprised as the small looking town is much larger than it seems. It has it&#39;s own little Railway Station. A relatively large bazaar too. I wasn&#39;t able to take any...<br>

    I wasn&#39;t able to post the last few days because I didn&#39;t have my laptop with me. I&#39;m going to write about the four days I missed. Day 04 to 06: Wedding One of the main purposes of this trip was to attend my cousins wedding. The wedding was a three day event. The first and second day(Day 4 &amp; 5), was in Islamabad. The third day(Day 6), was in Abbottabad. It was really cold...<br>

    Today was Day 3 of my trip. We went to Sheikh Abad, Mansehra - my village. It&#39;s a beautiful little place located in Mansehra. Both of my parents grew up there and a lot of my family lives there so it was a very fun trip. We met our family, ate(a lot) and created new memories. Rather than just talking about Sheikh Abad, I&#39;m going to show it to you. Here are the few photos...<br>
