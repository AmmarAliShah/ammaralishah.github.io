        Psychobabble: The pop culture and Hollywood gossip podcast you'll love

    I discovered podcasts almost two years ago and got addicted to them. I would listen to them all the time and was subscribed to like a hundred different ones, but slowly I started losing interest and now I only listen to a few. Psychobabble is a podcast I recently discovered and fell in love with. Wikipedia defines Psychobabble as: Psychobabble is a form of speech or writing that uses psychological jargon, buzzwords, and esoteric language...<br>

    Hey there! It’s been a while since I’ve communicated through this method. I would tell you where or with what I’ve been busy but that would be a lie. The truth is I’ve been doing nothing at all since my exams ended in May. I’ve spent the last three weeks watching the entire How I Met Your Mother show and season 6 of Game of Thrones. Pretty productive, right? I did plan on writing a...<br>

    NOTE 2: I’ll add in images later - tired atm NOTE 3: This is taking longer to update than I had planned. Sorry but I’m busy with finals 2016 is the year - the year I’ve been waiting for. I’m finally 18 years old. I’ve been waiting for so long to be able to write this post ( though I’m still 6 days late ). 18 is a really powerful digit once put in the...<br>

    I’ve always had a weird relationship with coffee. As soon as I finish a cup, I’m going to get sleepy - really sleepy! I won’t be able to keep my eyes open and if I lie down, I’ll fall asleep. It has the exact opposite effect on me, but, around an hour later, It’ll work it’s magic - I’ll be wide awake, unable to sleep. I had Coffee around 9PM. As soon as I gulped...<br>

    I have’t been able to post anything lately even though I wanted to. At first it was because I was running into problems with Jekyll ( more on this here ), but more recently due to depression - blogging depression. During the period of time when I couldn’t post, I went through the blog. It was really disappointing. This was not the blog I had envisioned. I started this blog, with the intention of it...<br>
