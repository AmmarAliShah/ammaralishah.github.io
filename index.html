    Today was Day 3 of my trip. We went to Sheikh Abad, Mansehra - my village. It&#39;s a beautiful little place located in Mansehra. Both of my parents grew up there and a lot of my family lives there so it was a very fun trip. We met our family, ate(a lot) and created new memories. Rather than just talking about Sheikh Abad, I&#39;m going to show it to you. Here are the few photos...<br>

    <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2015</span>
    Today was Day 2 of my trip. I woke up to a very, very cold Islamabad morning. Though I was really tired from the long train ride, I got up at 8 AM. After breakfast we started to get ready to leave for Abbottabad. That&#39;s right! After travelling in a train for 22 hours, we were setting out once again for a 3-hour journey by car to Abbottabad. We left around 2:30 PM and reached,...<br>

    <span class="post-date">14 Dec 2015</span>
    Today was Day 1 of my trip. The day was almost completely spent in the train. In a previous post, I wrote that I was really excited to finally travel in a train after almost ten years. Well I have to say I was rightly excited as the train ride was really fun though a bit long and tedious. Well first a shout-out to the Green Line Express team. The service was great. Our small...<br>

    <span class="post-date">13 Dec 2015</span>
    Due to lack of time and Internet(and partly due to the cold weather), this post went up a day late. I&#39;ve sent out tweets and wrote a blog post about it. Yes I&#39;m talking about going to Islamabad. I&#39;m going to leave in a few hours, but before I go, I thought I should share my bag pack with you. Now this is not my only bag. I&#39;ve got three more bags(!!). This is my...<br>

    If you follow me on Twitter, which you probably don&#39;t, you must have spotted something I tweeted out a few days ago: It&#39;s final - I&#39;m going to Islamabad in a week ☺☺&mdash; Ammar Ali Shah (@AmmarAliShahK) December 4, 2015 I&#39;m going to Islamabad on Sunday(Dec 14) i.e Tomorrow Night!!! It&#39;ll be around a two weeks trip and I&#39;ll be back in Karachi before the end of the year(hopefully). The main reason for the journey...<br>
