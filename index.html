    I write this listening to Hero by Family of the Year. It&#39;s an amazing song and you should listen to it. I first heard it while watching, Boyhood, a few days ago. I don&#39;t always listen to music when I&#39;m writing but I&#39;m addicted to Hero right now. This post isn&#39;t about the song, nor is it about Boyhood - it could be, but it isn&#39;t. This post is actually about my blog, this blog...<br>

    A few months ago, in August, I changed my smartphone and bought the Motorola Droid Maxx. I&#39;ve been using the phone as my daily driver since and hadn&#39;t run into a problem with it though it was the 16-gig version and I had to do a bit of memory management but everything else was great. The great thing about this phone is that it&#39;s packed with a huge battery which is advertised to &quot;last for...<br>

    Picture by Huzefa Mustafa The time has come for me to admit my crimes: I haven&#39;t been loyal to this blog and to the people who read it. In my very first post, I promised I would fall into some kind of regularity of blogging after I start High School. A few weeks after that, when I quit CS50, I made yet another promise that I would post about my code journey every week. I...<br>

    It&#39;s been 2 weeks since I took my JavaScript pledge and it&#39;s Sunday night which means time for my weekly report. This week wasn&#39;t productive at all and I did even worse than last time. I read Chapter 5 of Eloquent JavaScript I read Learn HTML &amp; CSS by Shay Howe I built a practice website(HTML &amp; CSS) Solved the &quot;reverse an array&quot; challenge That&#39;s all I did this week. I hope I&#39;ll do better...<br>
