		<!--<p><p><img src="media/i-talk.jpg" alt="I Talk - Ammar Shah" /></p>

<p>Let me put it straight out: <strong>“I love to talk”</strong>.</p>

<p>It’s something I do all day, everyday. No really, ask my friends if you don’t believe me. Most people might not think much of this but I admire <em>the art of talking</em> and also, the people who can do that really well.</p>

<p>People such as <em>Jesse Eisenberg</em>.</p>

<p><img src="media/je.jpg" alt="Jesse Eisenberg" /></p>

<p>That guy is a true master in the art of speaking. I just love his fast-paced voiced( <strong>Although it’s something he did get naturally but still…</strong> ). I’ve spent countless hours imitating his words from <em>The Social Network</em> and <em>Now You See Me</em>.</p>

<p>There are people out there who don’t really understand <strong>“The Art of Speaking”</strong> and they probably never will. They might find it as something that the majority of the population can do. They may argue that this isn’t a form of art or isn’t really a skill, or it’s not even a good thing  but I beg to defer!</p>

<p>Art is used to express oneself and there is no better way to express yourself than using your voice. For those who say that talking isn’t a skill, I’d like to ask them that how many times have people listened with 100% attention while they talked. No one wants to hear people talk unless they have that magic in their voice.</p>

<p>I for one admire this art. If you ever find me somewhere and are thinking of a conversation topic, this is one. If you too are an admirer of this art, hit it in the comments and I’m very sure we’ll get along very well. (If you’re against this, I still wanna hear it so don’t shy away)</p>

		<!--<p><p><img src="https://static.pexels.com/photos/35177/pexels-photo.jpg" alt="Mission 'More Social'" /></p>

<p>The last couple of months have been so busy with teaching 5 hours a day, Gym, Pokemon Go, client work(I’m a freelance developer), learning to drive and most recently school, that I’ve hardly had time to use social media.</p>

<p><em>I’ve Tweeted about 10 times in the past 2 weeks.</em></p>

<p><em>I last changed my Facebook display in 2014</em> (Also my picture anywhere else online)</p>

<p><em>My last Instagram post was around 12 weeks ago</em></p>

<p>The list goes on and on…</p>

<p>The point is, I’ve been more or less a ghost on social media for the last few months. I used to be really active on sites like Quora and Instagram but over time I haven’t been able to keep up and I’m not happy about that.</p>

<p>So, I’ve taken on a little mission:  <strong>Mission ‘More Social’</strong></p>

<p>I’m going to slowly try to be more active on social media sites. I’m going to start with the big three i.e. Facebook, Twitter and Google Plus(Yes!) and then move on to others like Instagram, Quora, Tumblr and the rest. This, though, <strong>does not</strong> mean that all of a sudden I’ll be very active on all my social accounts. I’m going to slowly use them a little more and then find out which socials I need and which I don’t, and then I’ll be active on the ones I need/like.</p>

<p>That’s the plan for now!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mission ‘More Social’ is go!</p>

			<h1><a href="/">Psychobabble: The pop culture and Hollywood gossip podcast you'll love</a></h1>

<p>I discovered podcasts almost two years ago and got addicted to them. I would listen to them all the time and was subscribed to like a hundred different ones, but slowly I started losing interest  and now I only listen to a few.</p>

<p>Psychobabble is a podcast I recently discovered and fell in love with.</p>

<p>Wikipedia defines Psychobabble as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Psychobabble is a form of speech or writing that uses psychological jargon, buzzwords, and esoteric language to create an impression of truth or plausibility.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The podcast, hosted by YouTube stars <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Oakley">Tyler Oakley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/koreykuhl">Korey Kuhl</a>, is about Pop culture and Holywood gossip. The two best friends take you through a number of topics in the thirty minutes to one hour duration of the show. In one of the episodes, the hosts tell us that the idea behind this podcast was to turn the listener into their third BFF and just gossip around. Well, if that was the idea, then mission accomplished!</p>

<p>The podcast also has a side where they give out advice to listeners who email them their questions. That’s a very cool feature too considering that a lot of kids consider such internet personalities to be their role models and what could be better than sharing your problems with them.</p>

<p>The podcast itself is great as you’re promised stories that you’ve never heard in videos and listening to the podcast gives you a hangout kind of feeling so it’s great to listen to.</p>

<p>You can listen to the podcast on <a href="https://soundcloud.com/psychobabbletyleroakley">SoundCloud</a> or <a href="https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.com%2Fpsychobabble">iTunes</a>.

<p>Hey there! It’s been a while since I’ve communicated through this method. I would tell you where or with what I’ve been busy but that would be a lie.</p>

<p>The truth is I’ve been doing nothing at all since my exams ended in May. I’ve spent the last three weeks watching the entire <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/">How I Met Your Mother</a> show and season 6 of <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/">Game of Thrones</a>. Pretty productive, right?</p>

<p>I did plan on writing a ton and doing a lot of other stuff, but I ended up doing none of that. I did however learn to drive which is very cool.</p>

<p>I also <em>did</em> try writing but it just didn’t happen.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Does it ever happen to ya&#39;ll that you&#39;re writing an article and half way through you think it&#39;s crap and just want to delete it?</p>&mdash; Ammar Ali Shah (@AmmarAliShahK) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK/status/739990380192616448">June 7, 2016</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>So today I finally took out some time to write this. It’s not what I had in mind when I planned that I was going to write this summer but it’s something at least! I also started on some code so that’s a little progress in that area too. Hopefully I’ll be able to publish all those article ideas I have in my notes before school starts again in August.</p>

<p>Also, I’m planing on starting a book on wattpad so you can follow me there for more news on that: <a href="https://www.wattpad.com/user/AmmarAliShah">My Wattpad Profile</a></p>

<p>Until next time, cheers!</p>

  <p>NOTE 3: This is taking longer to update than I had planned. Sorry but I’m busy with finals</p>

<p>2016 is the year - the year I’ve been waiting for.</p>

<p><strong>I’m finally 18 years old</strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve been waiting for so long to be able to write this post ( though I’m still 6 days late ).</p>

<p>18 is a really powerful digit once put in the age field. Like a key-card, it opens up a wonderful land of possibilities. ( At least in Pakistan it does ). You can finally get a bank account, and a driving license and all of those other things you want but don’t necessarily need. Basically, you’re officially an adult.</p>

<p>There’s just something to that sentence that makes me happy.</p>

<hr />

<p>Birthdays are also great in the sense that a lot of people that you haven’t talked to you in a while talk to you. It makes you realize how many people actually care about you. Someone took out seven seconds of their life just to post “Happy Birthday” on your Facebook timeline. Then there are those who try their best to wish to the exact second the clock hits 12. Those who want to be the first to wish you, not because you’re some kind of celebrity. It’s just because they care. There are those who spent time in making those collages for you. Took time to post a picture on your wall. Took time to call you. Took time to message you. In one way or another, made you realize that <em>Hey we are here for you</em>. Then there are also those people who wish you a little late - maybe only a few hours after you end. They feel ashamed. They apologize. They shouldn’t really. It’s not their duty to wish you a Happy Birthday. Again, if they feel sorry for not wishing you on time, they are amazing people. Hold on to them.</p>

<p>There’s also another very special group of people. Those who wish you IRL (In Real Life). Those who come to see you and hug you and wish you a happy birthday. They don’t need to first, because they are there. Right in front of you. You can touch them and hug them and kiss them and whatever. An emoji may do a lot but it can never do what a real hug can.</p>

<p>I’ve been blessed with all of these people. I had over a 100 people wish me this year. A 100 people. That’s big for me. I’m no celebrity. I’m just a regular teenager but still. I had over 5 people who rushed to be first. I had people who took time to post pictures. People who took time to write something for me. People who texted or called me. Those who posted a Snapchat story. Those who just sent me a Happy Birthday tweet. People used all sorts of ways. Some went out of their way to make this birthday really special. They drove to my house using Google Maps ( they didn’t know where I live ) following me through the location service powered by WhatsApp. It was a big step. It could’ve been wrong. There was more chance of failure than anything else. Location services are unreliable. Everyone knows that, but they still tracked me down, surprised me, ruined my clothes by hitting me with over a dozen eggs, and bought a cake for me. This is how much they cared. There were people who were late, but I don’t mind. They still cared enough to wish me. That’s all that matters.</p>

<p>This really helped me realize that over the last 18 years, I’ve met some <em>crazy</em> people and have made a lot of faithful friends.</p>

<p>So the TL;DR version of this post would be, “Thank You for wishing me on my Birthday! I truly love you for that - even if you were late or you never did, don’t worry, I still do :)”</p>

		<!--<p><p>I’ve always had a weird relationship with coffee.</p>

<p>As soon as I finish a cup, I’m going to get sleepy - <em>really</em> sleepy! I won’t be able to keep my eyes open and if I lie down, I’ll fall asleep. It has the exact opposite effect on me, <strong>but</strong>, around an hour later, It’ll work it’s magic - I’ll be wide awake, unable to sleep.</p>

<p>I had Coffee around 9PM. As soon as I gulped it down, like some kind of immediate effecting drug you see in the movies, I started getting sleepy. So much sleepy that I dropped my phone from my hand. At 10PM, again like the previous pill but with the exact opposite effect, I’m wide awake. No more yawning, no more of my eyes closing, no more of dropping my phone because I dozed off for a second.</p>

<p>Now I’m awake - <em>wide awake</em>.</p>

<p>It’s 2:31AM as I write this. I woke up at 6AM the previous day, like I do everyday ( I don’t know why, I just do! ). I’ve had only about 6 hours of sleep in the last 25 hours ( approximately ).</p>

<p>I have two ways to go to sleep right now, have another cup of coffee so that I fall asleep instantly and wake up at 6 ( in about 4 hours), or I just wait for sweet sweet sleep to come while I read article after article online. I could also execute both of them but I don’t want to end up sleeping with my head on my keyboard ( it isn’t very comfortable )</p>

<p>Either way, I’m going to end up sleeping <em>somewhere</em> and <em>somehow</em> but I’ll still be up at 6AM. I don’t really know why, but my body refuses to sleep after that time. It’s still a mystery to me why this happens and if any one of you is a professional in this field ( or just knowledgeable ), feel free to discuss this with me in the comments below or on <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">Twitter</a>.</p>

<p>During the period of time when I couldn’t post, I went through the blog. It was really disappointing. This was not the blog I had envisioned.

This didn’t feel like my blog.</p>

<p><strong>This was not my blog</strong>, at least not the one I wanted it to be.</p>

<p>It’s my fault really. I thought this blog could be anything but I was wrong. If this blog tries to be everything, it will turn into nothing, like it did.</p>

<p>This blog felt wrong to me as I read it back. I constantly thought what is this blog even about. The best thing I could come up with was that this was an excuse blog. You get an excuse with every post.</p>

<p>The most this blog ever got to what I wanted it to be was during my <a href="/2015/12/12/isl-trip/">winter trip to Islamabad</a> a few months ago. That was just me writing about my day, what I did. Writing those posts were fun. It was as if I was inviting the reader to explore with me. That was what I wanted this blog to be. No, not a travel blog, but my brain. This blog is a digital representation of me. So far, it portrays me as a messed up person who makes too many excuses.</p>

<p>Over the last few weeks, I got really sick of this blog. <strong>I hated my own blog!</strong> I couldn’t get myself to post.</p>

<p>So, it was time to make changes.</p>

<p>The first thing I did, was open up Google Docs and layed out my blogging plan. I wrote about all the things I want to write about and distributed them to blogs according to their topic. One thing I straight out got of it was that I need <em>at least</em> one more blog for my code life.</p>

<p>I wasted no time in creating a new blog, “<a href="http://ammarcodes.blogspot.com/">Ammar Codes</a>”. So far I’ve made 3 posts on that blog. If you ever read my blog for the code/tech stuff, you should go there.</p>

<p>That left behind this blog - <em>what was I going to post on this blog?</em></p>

<p>I really wanted this blog to be a representation of me. I love reading, watching movies/shows, food, travelling and a lot of other things. That was all a part of my life, so there was my answer, I turned this blog into a lifestyle blog.</p>

<p>Now what exactly does that mean? Well it means that this blog is going to be a mix or reviews, recommendations and travel logs. I’ll also be posting the occasional thoughts on a matter. So in short, if it’s happening in my life it’s on my blog.</p>

<p>I’m sure over time I’ll turn this into the blog I had originally planned. To ensure that, I’ve actually made a few rules.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No stock imagery</strong>. I’m going to use images I took/own or I won’t use them at all.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No schedule</strong>. I’m not going to burden myself into posting regularly. I might post once a month or 3 times in a week. This way, I won’t have to excuse myself for not posting.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>No click bait</strong>. This is serious. I don’t want to use click bait headlines to get people to read.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I’m also dropping the blog name. The blog doesn’t need a name. If it’s representing me, it will bear the same name as me. This transaction will take place once I shift my blog over to WordPress and buy the domain.</p>

<p>Well that’s all for now, best of luck to all of you!</p>

		<p>2016-01-23 10:43:00 +0500</p>
		<!--<p><p>Yes you read that correctly - an Android app by Microsoft.</p>

<p>The app is an alarm clock!</p>

<p>What’s special about this particular clock is that it does not just let you cancel your alarm - You have to play a game to turn it off!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/alarmMicrosoft1.jpg" alt="App home" /></p>

<p>The way it works is that when your alarm goes off, you are given two options you can swipe too - swipe left for snooze and swipe right to cancel.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/alarmMicrosoft2.jpg" alt="App options to swipe" /></p>

<p>If you swipe left, you get a five minutes snooze.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/alarmMicrosoft3.jpg" alt="Snooze" /></p>

<p>If you swipe right, you are presented with a small game - different every time.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/alarmMicrosoft4.jpg" alt="Play the game" /></p>

<p>Setting up an alarm is fairly simple and self explanatory.</p>

<p>I played around with a while and got quite interesting little things that would require me to either get out of bed, focus or turn on the light.</p>

<p>If you fail at the game, the alarm goes back to it’s previous state, that is the swipe part.</p>

<p>This is quite an interesting app as you <strong>can not</strong> turn the alarm off in your sleep.</p>

<p>This app is actually a part of Microsoft’s AI project, <a href="https://www.projectoxford.ai/">Project Oxford</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re someone who has trouble waking up, you might wanna try this app.</p>

<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.mimickeralarm">You download this app to your phone from here</a>!</p>

<p><a href="/2016/01/01/new-year/">It’s 2016!</a></p>

<p>It’s a new year, which means new goals, new things to focus on. Last year, <a href="/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x">I left CS50</a>. This year, I plan on ending what I started.</p>

<h2 id="whats-cs50x">What’s CS50x?</h2>

<p>According to the site, CS50 is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Harvard University’s introduction to the intellectual enterprises of computer science and the art of programming for majors and non-majors alike, with or without prior programming experience. An entry-level course taught by David J. Malan, CS50x teaches students how to think algorithmically and solve problems efficiently. Topics include abstraction, algorithms, data structures, encapsulation, resource management, security, software engineering, and web development. Languages include C, PHP, and JavaScript plus SQL, CSS, and HTML. Problem sets inspired by real-world domains of biology, cryptography, finance, forensics, and gaming. As of Fall 2015, the on-campus version of CS50x, CS50, was Harvard’s largest course.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The <em>“x”</em> refers to the online version of the <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">course on edx</a>.</p>

<h2 id="back-to-it">Back to it</h2>

<p>As I already said above, I started CS50x 2015 but <a href="/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x">I quit</a>, later on, promising to come back next year.</p>

<p><strong>Well it’s next year and time for me to fulfill my promise!</strong></p>

<p>So on January 1st, 2016, I signed up for CS50x 2016.</p>

<h2 id="current-progress">Current Progress</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>I tweet about my progress on <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">Twitter</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>As of right now, I’m done with Week 0 and pset 0.</p>

<p>I’m done with Week 1 lectures and am yet to start cracking pset 1 - hopefully I’ll do that today.</p>

<p>That’s all for now.</p>

<p>I’m aiming to get done with this, <em>this time</em>.</p>

<p>Till next week then!</p>

<p>Look at the calendar.</p>

<p>Look at the clock.</p>

<p><strong>It’s 2016!</strong></p>

<p>2015 is behind us and now 2016 is where we stand.</p>

<p>The page has turned and has given us yet another year to improve our lives and the lives of others around us.</p>

<p>If you have nothing else to be grateful for, just be grateful that you have been given the chance to live another day.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look back on 2015:</p>

<h2 id="a-look-back-on-2015">A look back on 2015</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/2015.jpg" alt="It's 2016" /></p>

<p>For me, <em>2015 was the year of change.</em></p>

<p>Now you may say that, <strong>“Ammar, that’s every year”</strong> but just hang on for a second.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look at what I’m talking about:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I joined the Free Code Camp team! An amazing experience. I got to work remotely as a team with people from all over the globe. Working on something I actually believe.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I got into Open-Source development.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2015/07/10/so-it-begins/">I started this blog</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I started and <a href="/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x//">left CS50x</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I got done with my CIEs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I switched schools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I joined <a href="https://www.zidisha.org/">Zidisha</a>, yet another non-profit.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2015/10/25/ammar-says/">I named this blog</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2015/12/01/year-at-fcc/">I completed a year at Free Code Camp</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="/2015/12/12/isl-trip/">I travelled in a train and I went on a Winter Trip and blogged about it, turning this blog into a travel blog</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>AND, <a href="http://ammaralishah.github.io/archive/">I wrote <strong>22</strong> blog posts</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>I could write a lot more changes but these are the main ones that mean something to me.</p>

<p>It’s been an amazing year and I’ve done so much. :))</p>

<p>## 2016?</p>

<p>Well that was my 2015.</p>

<p>Let’s hope 2016 brings even more exciting things in life, <em>because if life isn’t exciting, what is it?</em></p>

<p>Happy New Year to you all and I hope it is an exciting year for you all!</p>

<p>Today was Day 13 of my trip -  the final day!</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to post the last two days because my laptop messed up.</p>

<p>Here’s what happened:</p>

<h2 id="windows-10-messed-up">Windows 10 messed up!</h2>

<p>My system wouldn’t boot!</p>

<p>I sat down to write about my day but windows 10 wasn’t agreeing with me.</p>

<p>I tried again and again, but after an hour, I decided to go to bed and write in the morning.</p>

<p>If you <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">follow me on Twitter</a>, you may have seen this tweet:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Daily post is late because <a href="https://twitter.com/Windows">@Windows</a> 10 is messing up...my laptop won&#39;t boot!</p>&mdash; Ammar Ali Shah (@AmmarAliShahK) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK/status/680248334171377664">December 25, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>In the morning, I tried again - no luck!</p>

<p>I got serious about fixing this problem and after trying everything I could, I did what I didn’t want to - I had to reset my windows.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Let&#39;s just hope this fixes it <a href="https://t.co/i3ouTWLRgN">pic.twitter.com/i3ouTWLRgN</a></p>&mdash; Ammar Ali Shah (@AmmarAliShahK) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK/status/680258339821981696">December 25, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>Reset worked but I lost all of my apps which included Git and Jekyll, the two main <a href="/2015/07/10/so-it-begins/">things I need to run my blog</a>.</p>

<p>I had no time left to download and install everything again so I wasn’t able to post that day too!</p>

<p>I spent today travelling and got back home(Karachi) only a few hours ago.</p>

<p>I had to reset windows again then download everything.</p>

<p>It’s working fine now but I’ll have to look into this again.</p>

<p>So this is why this post went up so late.</p>

<p>Let’s begin with my last days now.</p>

<h2 id="day-11--12-exploring-abbottabad">Day 11 &amp; 12: Exploring Abbottabad</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/d11-13isl/02.jpg" alt="Abbottabad" /></p>

<p>Day 11 was the day I finally got time to explore Abbottabad.</p>

<p><a href="/2015/12/15/d2-abbott-isl/">Last time</a>, I didn’t get any time at all because I got there late and had to leave for <a href="/2015/12/16/d3-sheikhabad-isl/">Sheikh Abad</a> the next day.</p>

<p>So I actually spent Day 11 and some of Day 12 exploring Abbottabad.</p>

<p>On Day 12, at around 5 PM, we went to the <a href="http://www.daewoo.com.pk/terminal_view.asp?menu_set=5&amp;submenu_set=2&amp;page_title=Kakul&amp;terminal_code=45">Daewoo terminal in Kakul</a> to leave for Karachi.</p>

<p><em>Here are the few photos I took while exploring Abbottabad:</em></p>

<p><img src="/assets/d11-13isl/03.jpg" alt="Abbottabad" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/d11-13isl/04.jpg" alt="Abbottabad" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/d11-13isl/05.jpg" alt="Abbottabad" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/d11-13isl/06.jpg" alt="Abbottabad" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/d11-13isl/07.jpg" alt="Abbottabad" /></p>

<h2 id="day-13-daewoo">Day 13: Daewoo</h2>

<p><img src="/assets/daewoo.jpg" alt="Daewoo" /></p>

<p>Day 13 was entirely spent in the bus for Karachi.</p>

<p>Unlike [my experience with railway(/2015/12/14/d1-train-isl/), my experience with Daewoo wasn’t great.</p>

<p>We weren’t able to get tickets for anything else so we had no other choice then this.</p>

<p>The thing that made this experience really bad was the stops.</p>

<p>The bus took too many stops for too long.</p>

<p>They would announce a fifteen minute stop and stay for over an hour.</p>

<p>They took a little over 24 hours to get us from Rawalpindi to Karachi.</p>

<p>The service and the food was awful too.</p>

<p>They served us the same meal four times!!</p>

<p>A meal which consisted of a sandwich, a biscuit and two sweets!</p>

<p><em>Here are the few photos I took somewhere of while passing through Sukkur, Sindh:</em></p>

<p>Today was Day 10 of my trip. I wasn’t able to write yesterday so this post will cover that too!</p>

<p>So Day 9 &amp; 10 were spent in Sheikhabad.</p>

<p>This was my second visit to Sheikhabad for this trip.</p>

<p><a href="/2015/12/16/d3-sheikhabad-isl/">The first one was a bit short.</a></p>

<p>This trip was a bit longer than the <a href="/2015/12/16/d3-sheikhabad-isl/">last one</a>.</p>

<p>We stayed there for almost two days.</p>

<p>This time it rained too!</p>

<p>I did a bit of exploring this time and took more pictures.</p>

<p>I even took some pictures of the animals and of the rain!</p>

<p>Just like before, I’ll share them with you :))</p>

<p>Today was Day 8 of my trip.</p>

<p>We went to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havelian">Havelian</a>, to visit my cousin.</p>

<p>While my family sat in their house sipping tea and talking, I set out with my cousin to explore Havelian.</p>

<p>I took a walk around the place.</p>

<p>I was pleasantly surprised as the small looking town is much larger than it seems.</p>

<p>It has it’s own little Railway Station.</p>

<p>A relatively large bazaar too.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to take any pictures though!</p>

<p>After eating dinner, I returned to Abbottabad.</p>

<p>This was Day 8. Let’s see where I go to tomorrow.</p>

<p>I’m going to write about the four days I missed.</p>

<h2 id="day-04-to-06-wedding">Day 04 to 06: Wedding</h2>

<p>One of the main purposes of this trip was to attend my cousins wedding.</p>

<p>The wedding was a three day event.</p>

<p>The first and second day(Day 4 &amp; 5), was in Islamabad.</p>

<p>The third day(Day 6), was in Abbottabad.</p>

<p>It was really cold and I had to wear several articles of clothing.</p>

<p>Don’t have much to say about it except that it was nice to hang out with the <strong>complete</strong> family.</p>

<h2 id="day-07-kenya">Day 07: Kenya</h2>

<p><img src="/../assets/kenyaisl/01.jpg" alt="Kenya" /></p>

<p>On Day 7 I went to Kenya.</p>

<p>Kenya is a small village a little farther away from Mansehra.</p>

<p>Here’s something I found out the <strong>hard way</strong>: <em>“It’s a really really, really cold place.”</em></p>

<p>Yes! That cold.</p>

<p>It was a short trip due to the cold.</p>

<p>I was shivering from the cold so  didn’t take many pictures.</p>

<p><em>Here are the few photos I took:</em></p>

<p>Today was Day 3 of my trip.</p>

<p>We went to Sheikh Abad, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansehra">Mansehra</a> - my village.</p>

<p>It’s a beautiful little place located in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansehra">Mansehra</a>.</p>

<p>Both of my parents grew up there and a lot of my family lives there so it was a very fun trip.</p>

<p>We met our family, ate(a lot) and created new memories.</p>

<p>Rather than just talking about Sheikh Abad, I’m going to show it to you.</p>

<p>I woke up to a very, very cold Islamabad morning.</p>

<p>Though I was really tired from <a href="/2015/12/14/d1-train-isl/">the long train ride</a>, I got up at 8 AM.</p>

<p>After breakfast we started to get ready to leave for Abbottabad.</p>

<p>That’s right! After travelling in a train for 22 hours, we were setting out once again for a 3-hour journey by car to Abbottabad.</p>

<p>We left around 2:30 PM and reached, a more colder Abbottabad around 6 PM.</p>

<p>During this over 3-hour ride, we stopped a few times to enjoy the view or just to grab a quick snack from the places we crossed.</p>

<p>The ride wasn’t as much fun as it was tiring so I didn’t really take many pictures.</p>

<p>I’m just glad to have reached Abbottabad safely.</p>

<p>Better sleep now since I have another adventure for Day 3 ahead!</p>

<p>The day was almost completely spent in the train.</p>

<p>In a <a href="isl15">previous post</a>, I wrote that I was really excited to finally travel in a train after almost ten years.</p>

<p>Well, I have to say I was rightly excited as the train ride was really fun though a bit long and tedious.</p>

<p>Well, first a shout-out to the Green Line Express team.</p>

<p>The service was great.</p>

<p>Our small little Train cabin had a TV, WiFi and blankets.</p>

<p>Though nothing was perfect(the WiFi didn’t work for 99% of the journey and the pillows were hard to sleep on), it still was a reasonably comfortable journey given that the train was very punctual.</p>

<p>I wasn’t able to <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">tweet</a> or <a href="https://www.periscope.tv/AmmarAliShahK">‘scope</a> from the train like I had planned to but oh well.</p>

<p>After an almost 22-hour train ride, I finally stepped out of the train ready to face the cold winter air of Rawalpindi.</p>

<p>My cousins house was in Islamabad and not in Rawalpindi and so we had to take a short ride in a car to get to their place.</p>

<p>Half an hour later, I was sitting with my cousins and family at their house in Islamabad.</p>

<p>Time to sleep now.</p>

<p>I need to rest to get ready for Day 2!</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Due to lack of time and Internet(and partly due to the cold weather), this post went up a day late.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I’ve sent out tweets and wrote a blog post about it.</p>

<p>Yes I’m talking about going to Islamabad.</p>

<p>I’m going to leave in a few hours, but before I go, I thought I should share my bag pack with you.</p>

<p>Now this is not my only bag.</p>

<p>I’ve got three more bags(!!).</p>

<p>This is my bag pack.</p>

<p>Let’s get started now, shall we.</p>

<h2 id="the-bag">The Bag</h2>

<p><img src="media/ISL15/bag/bag.jpg" alt="Bag Pack" /></p>

<p>So first of all the bag itself:</p>

<p>The bag is a Camel Mountain laptop bag which I bought from a local market here about an year ago.</p>

<p>It’s in a <em>Grey-like color</em> though I’d prefer <em>Black</em> to match my heart(Just kidding!{or am I?})</p>

<p>What I really like about the bag is that it’s really spacious and has just the right amount of padding so the back is soft and still strong enough to carry quite some weight.</p>

<p>The bag has served me well and I’m sure it will the next few years.</p>

<p>You can grab this bag for yourself from here</p>

<h2 id="whats-inside">What’s inside</h2>

<p><img src="media/ISL15/bag/contents.jpg" alt="Bag Pack" /></p>

<p>Okay so now for the contents of the bag.</p>

<p>Normally I would stuff this blog with a lot and lot of stuff, but since I had to pack light for this trip, I only added things that I really needed.</p>

<p><img src="media/ISL15/bag/item.jpg" alt="Bag Pack" /></p>

<p>Here’s a list of everything:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My HP 620 Notebook + Charger</li>
  <li>Laptop Cooler</li>
  <li>A notepad</li>
  <li><strong>The Forty Rules of Love</strong> by Elif Shafak (<em>The book I’m currently reading</em>)</li>
  <li>Sony Earphones</li>
  <li>USB to PS/2 convertor</li>
  <li>VGA Display Cable</li>
  <li>Mini Speakers</li>
  <li>USB Sticks &amp; SD Card Reader</li>
  <li>Mouse</li>
  <li>USB Port Extender</li>
  <li>Various Chargers for various devices</li>
</ul>

<p>The list may look long, but my bag is empty for the most part.</p>

<p>I’m going to Islamabad on Sunday(Dec 14) i.e Tomorrow Night!!!</p>

<p>It’ll be roughly around a two weeks trip and I’ll be back in Karachi before the end of the year(hopefully).</p>

<p>The main reason for the journey is to attend my cousin’s weeding who is FINALLY getting married next week.</p>

<p><em>Congratulations to him! :))</em></p>

<p>I’m really excited to go because I get to travel in a train for the journey and I haven’t been on a train since about 10 or 12 years!</p>

<p>On the other hand, I’m a bit scared that I won’t be able to bear the cold.</p>

<p>Oh well!</p>

<p>I guess I’ll find out!</p>

<h3 id="join-me">Join me!</h3>

<p>The two weeks I’ll be on the trip, I’m going to go all “<em>travel bloggy</em>” everywhere.</p>

		<!--<p><p><img src="media/year-fcc.png" alt="Free Code Camp" /></p>

<p>Today is the end of my first year at Free Code Camp.</p>

<p>Let’s take a look back:</p>

<h3 id="where-it-all-began">Where it all began</h3>

<p>One year ago today, I was going through my Facebook feed and saw a post by <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ziakhan">Zia Khan</a>.</p>

<p>It was an article about <a href="http://blog.freecodecamp.com/2014/11/a-cautionary-tale-of-learning-to-code.html">the struggle of learning to code</a>.</p>

<p>As someone who had been learning to code since 2012, I was genuinely interested.</p>

<p>I began reading. It was written by <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia">Quincy Larson</a>.</p>

<p>Towards the end, there was a link to <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>.</p>

<p>I decided to sign up, because:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>It was free.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It was a complete full-stack track</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The founder was self-learned too</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="hello-world">Hello World</h3>

<p>After signup I was presented with a small getting started video.</p>

<p>I was taken to a chat room where I was suppose to introduce myself.</p>

<p>I did the obvious and posted “Hello World”.</p>

<p>Almost immediately I was welcomed.</p>

<p>That’s the thing that’s really different about Free Code Camp - <strong>The Community</strong>.</p>

<p>I still remember what was going on when I joined the chat.</p>

<p>I had interrupted a discussion on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pluto">Pluto</a> between <a href="https://twitter.com/iheartkode">Mark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/kodriscoll_dev">Kathy</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/ryanmalm">Ryan</a>.</p>

<p>Later on I found out that all three of them were on the volunteer team.</p>

<h3 id="team-fcc">Team FCC</h3>

<p><img src="media/Ammar-fcc.png" alt="My bio on the team site" /></p>

<p>So I continued logging in everyday.</p>

<p>Completing challenges.</p>

<p>Talking to people in the chat.</p>

<p>More and more people joined and I followed suit and began welcoming new people.</p>

<p>I was addicted to the chat, to the people, to FCC.</p>

<p>I would be on the computer all day.</p>

<p>After a month, I knew every single person in the chat - I welcomed more than half of them.</p>

<p>New year came around, 2015.</p>

<p><strong>January 5th</strong>.</p>

<p>I got a private message from Quincy Larson.</p>

<p>He thanked me for helping out in the chat.</p>

<p>I was really happy.</p>

<p>He then asked me if I wanted to join the team.</p>

<p>I said yes.</p>

<p>We had a brief Skype session.</p>

<p>He added me to a private “Camp Counselors” room.</p>

<p>He introduced me.</p>

<p>It was official - I was on team FCC.</p>

<h3 id="a-year-later">A year later</h3>

<p>Fast forward a year, and here we are.</p>

<p>A lot has happened in the last 11 months.</p>

<p>Free Code Camp has grown to 150k+ campers.</p>

<p>The courses have changed completely.</p>

<p>FCC has enabled people to get jobs.</p>

<p>Basically, FCC is no longer the, small group of people chatting and learning to code, that it used to be.</p>

<p><strong>A lot has change and a lot hasn’t.</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li>The community is still great.</li>
  <li>When you join, along with people, a bot welcomes you!(That’s 2015 for ya!)</li>
  <li>Free Code Camp is still free and will remain so.</li>
  <li>Free Code Camp is still <a href="https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp">Open-Source</a></li>
  <li>Rather than a team of fixed people, FCC now has many people contributing to the community through GitHub.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>To sum it up, Free Code Camp has been a great experience.</p>

<p>I’ve managed to learn more in the year at Free Code Camp than I had managed to learn in two years on my own.</p>

<p>Free Code Camp is where it is today, because of the hard work of great people like <a href="https://twitter.com/ossia">Quincy</a>,  <a href="https://twitter.com/BerkeleyTrue">Berkeley</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/terakilobyte">Nathan</a>.</p>

<p>I suggest Free Code Camp to almost everyone who wants to learn to code.</p>

<p><em>Why?</em></p>

<h3 id="lets-meet-ellie">Let’s meet Ellie</h3>

<p><img src="media/ellie.jpg" alt="Ellie Adam" /></p>

<p>Ellie Adam is a designer and web developer based in Seattle, Washington. I met Ellie through <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com">Free Code Camp</a>, where she was on the volunteer team with me. Ellie did some design work for Free Code Camp and that’s how I knew about her skills.</p>

<h3 id="the-favor">The Favor</h3>

<p>I started a blog called <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thewormofficial">The Worm Official</a> in 2014. A few months ago, I decided the blog needed a makeover. I began working on a new design for the site on a new CMS, domain and what not. Halfway through, I decided I needed a new logo to go along with this, since that old image I got off of Google wouldn’t do anymore!</p>

<p><img src="media/two-o.jpg" alt="The old logo" /></p>

<p>Since I had no money to actually pay a designer for a new logo, I contacted Ellie. I asked her for a favor and told her what I needed. I was surprised to find that now only did she agree, but she took the job very seriously and presented me with various options within just two days! Not only this, but she even offered to design a new UI for the blog.</p>

<p>In the end Ellie designed two things for me:</p>

<p><img src="media/two-n.png" alt="The old logo" /></p>

<p><strong>a logo</strong>,</p>

<p><em>and</em>,</p>

<p><img src="media/two-b.png" alt="The old logo" /></p>

<p><strong>a banner</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>I think I couldn’t have found a better person for the job even if I hired someone. Ellie is a passionate, responsible, and talented designer. Other than that, she’s just a great person. I’m pretty sure she’s the person you need if you have a design related job.</p>

<p>Ellie, if you’re reading this,</p>

<p><strong>Thank You for everything! You’re the best!</strong></p>

<p>Mobile phones have come a long way -  from clunky old devices to pocket computers. With every new release, they only get bigger and better - <em>better cameras, better screens, better operating systems, etc</em>. Phone manufacturers seem to be improving smartphones in every aspect except for one - “<strong>The Battery</strong>”.</p>

<p>There are few phones out there with <em>good battery life</em> - The <a href="http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_droid_maxx-5604.php">Motorola Droid Maxx</a> is one of those few, although <a href="maxx-battery-issue">I’ve been facing a problem with its battery</a>. Here’s the thing phone manufacturers don’t get: <strong>What good is a device with a kickass screen and a great camera but which only has six hours of battery?</strong> If I were to go review most of the the newly released phones, I’d point out one similarity between all of them - <em>the battery sucks</em>!</p>

<p>So this blog post is for phone manufacturers, listen up ya’ll:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We love everything you’re doing with our smartphones - Give us speed, give us better screens, give us better cameras but for Gods sake, GIVE US BETTER BATTERIES!!!</p>

<p>I write this listening to <a href="https://youtu.be/mHeK0Cwr9sg">Hero by Family of the Year</a>. It’s an amazing song and you should listen to it. I first heard it while watching, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/">Boyhood</a>, a few days ago. I don’t always listen to music when I’m writing but I’m addicted to Hero right now.  This post isn’t about the song, nor is it about Boyhood - it could be, but it isn’t.  This post is actually about my blog, <em>this blog</em> which I’ve made some changes to.</p>

<h3 id="why-the-change">Why the change?</h3>
<p>Before I start with what has changed, I want to explain my plan to you all. As I <a href="so-it-begins">stated before</a>, I’ve been blogging since 2012 because I love writing and sharing my thought with all of you. In 2014, I started <a href="http://thewormofficial.wordpress.com/">The Worm official</a> and wrote a few posts there. I spent the last few months building a new home for it. The last few weeks have been very tense for me as I was trying to decide a few things. Here’s a list of what I concluded:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’ll be shutting down The Worm Official but the old site will still be up as an archive.</li>
  <li>My focus will be on writing on this blog.</li>
  <li>Since I like to talk on a lot of topics, I will not be limiting this blog to a specific topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>As hard as it was for me, I’ve closed  “The Worm Official chapter” in my life and will soon be deleting it’s social accounts. This gives me time to focus more on this blog. I’ll be writing here completely from now on. As mentioned above, I will not be following a specific topic. I still haven’t decided the frequency of my posts but I’m sure I’ll decide that too at some point in the near future. Now that that’s done, here’s what has changed:</p>

<h3 id="blog-name">Blog Name</h3>

<p><img src="media/blog-name.JPG" alt="Ammar Says Homepage" /></p>

<p>I’ve decided to name this blog, “<strong>Ammar Says</strong>”. The tagline accompanying this name is “<strong>Freshly Published Thoughts on the world!</strong>”. <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">Let me know</a> your thoughts on the name and tagline - I promise I don’t bite!</p>

<h3 id="sidebar">Sidebar</h3>

<p><img src="media/sidebar.JPG" alt="Ammar Says Homepage" /></p>

<p>I’ve also made some changes to the side/top nav of the site. On every page, you’ll see the description changes. I just thought it looked good. <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">What do you think?</a></p>

<h3 id="writing-archive">Writing Archive</h3>

<p><img src="media/archive.JPG" alt="Ammar Says Homepage" /></p>

<p>I also added in a <a href="/writing/">writing archive</a>. It lists all my posts that are available online.</p>

<hr />

<p>That’s everything I’ve changed visually. I also made a few changes that don’t really effect your experience so there’s no point in talking about that. I care a lot about User Experience and that’s why I want you to <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">tell me</a> about your experience because I care about you :))</p>

		<p>2015-10-24 08:50:00 +0500</p>
		<!--<p><p><img src="media/maxx-battery.png" alt="Droid Maxx" /></p>

<p>A few months ago, in August, I changed my smartphone and bought the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones/droid-maxx/m-droid-maxx.html">Motorola Droid Maxx</a>. I’ve been using the phone as my daily driver since and hadn’t run into a problem with it though it was the 16-gig version and I had to do a bit of memory management but everything else was great. The great thing about this phone is that it’s packed with a huge battery which is advertised to “<em>last for up to 48 hours on a single charge</em>”. I’m out a lot and this battery was just what I needed. Things would’ve been percect if I had bought the 32-gig version but you don’t get everything you wish for(and that’s okay).</p>

<p>The last few weeks, the battery started draining really fast - 7 - 10 hours / charge. The phone also started to heat up a but if used constantly. As busy as I am, I didn’t put much thought into it until yesterday when I saw that it was really turning into a problem. A full charge(which would take up to 3 hours) was draining in just 7 hours! A little CPU intensive task would raise the temperature above 40°C!</p>

<p>A quick Google search and <strong>a lot</strong> of forum reading gave me a lot of information:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I was not alone. A lot of other Droid Maxx owners were facing the same problem</li>
  <li>Most people started having this problem after they upgraded to Android 4.4 - my phone came with 4.4 pre-installed</li>
  <li><strong>The good news</strong> - Most people were able to fix the problem by doing simple things such as re-calibrating the battery, or formatting the phone or clearing the cache</li>
</ul>

<p>I’ve decided to give the <em>factory reset</em> option a try. I’ll lose all my data in the process so I’m backing it all up to the cloud and my computer as I type this. Once it’s done, I’ll factory reset the phone and clear the cache too. I hope that’ll fix the problem. If not, I’m going to try re-calibrating the battery. If all fails, I’ll be contacting support but hopefully it won’t come to that.</p>

<hr />
<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve made small changes to the blog. I’m trying things out and once I think everything is the way I want it to be, I’ll be writing a post about the changes and explaining what I did and why I did it.</p>

<p>The time has come for me to admit my crimes:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I haven’t been loyal to this blog and to the people who read it. In my <a href="so-it-begins">very first post</a>, I promised I would fall into some kind of regularity of blogging after I start High School. A few weeks after that, when <a href="leaving-cs50x15">I quit CS50</a>, I made yet another promise that I would post about my code journey every week. I haven’t been able to fulfill either of those promises :-(</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Phew!</em> Good thing I got that off my chest, I can sleep peacefully now. Am I done here then? Not quite… being the nice guy I am, I’m going to tell you exactly why I haven’t been able to keep my promises, or in-other-words, I’m going to play the blame game :))</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR I blame my High School</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="so-it-begins">mentioned before</a>, I started High School in the second week of August and had to adjust to my new schedule. Turns out, It’s practically impossible to do so. I leave for school at around 7 AM and return around 4 PM. By the time I change, shower and eat, It’s already over 5 PM. By the time I’m back to functioning properly, it’s over 7 PM and I have to start doing my homework which take two hours(yes they are trying to kill us). By 10 PM, I’m exhausted and just fall asleep. That’s my routine Monday through Friday. Hopefully this will earn me your sympathy and you’ll let me go for not keeping my promise.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>TL;DR  I found better ways to track my progress while being productive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I’ve laid out the practical impossibility of a blogging routine, I’m going to tell you about my weekends. Judging from my daily schedule, you might argue that I had time to write my weekly report on weekends, and you’re absolutely right. I could have written the weekly report, but I didn’t. At first, I forgot writing it every Sunday night and later on, I realized it was just another burden on me. I only had two free days every week and I could either be productive or worry about everything else I have to do. So I just made rough notes of what I did that day and decided to turn them into real posts later on(which I never did). <strong>So I’ve just decided to quit writing my weekly report</strong>. The only reason I was writing them was to track my progress right, well FCC, GitHub and other tools I use are already doing that!</p>

<p>FreeCodeCamp does a great job of tracking my daily progress so I don’t need to track it myself,</p>

<p><img src="media/FCC.JPG" alt="FreeCodeCamp progress" /></p>

<p>and so does GitHub.</p>

<p><img src="media/GHprog.JPG" alt="GitHub tracking" /></p>

<p>That frees me of the responsibly to track my progress and I can focus more on learning to code.</p>

<p>By now, I expect you warm-hearted people have forgiven me for not keeping my word and sympathies with me and my class fellows and are going to spam <a href="http://commecscollege.edu.pk/">my school</a> about the horrific timings. If that is the case, here’s <a href="mailto:info@commecscollege.edu.pk">their email</a>.</p>

<p>So basically this posts <em>officially</em> announces my previous promises are now no longer valid. To make it up for that, I’m going to make new promises :))</p>

<ul>
  <li>I’m going to go through the backlog of this blog and I’m going to update/edit all of my posts</li>
  <li>I’m going to try to blog more often about things that I want to write about(I said I’ll try)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want me to stay true to my word, you might wanna bug my school so much that they shorten our timings. It’s almost 11 AM so I’m gonna go and eat breakfast. <a href="mailto:info@commecscollege.edu.pk">Spam my school</a>!</p>

Well it’s Sunday and my time is up and as stated, this is y first weekly report. This week wasn’t as productive as I thought it would be due to some family events.

  <p>This blog post resulted in a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50/permalink/562182657262117/">long debate</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>
In my <a href="/so-it-begins.html">previous post</a>, I mentioned I started <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">Harvards CS50</a> on edx. Today, I decided to quit it and I un-enrolled from the class on edx. I made the decision after thinking on it long and hard so I'm not regretting what I did. Here's why I quit:
</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
To sum it up in a line, <em>I didn't have time for it</em>. I'm a web developer meaning what I do is related to the web - websites and web-apps. The course teaches C, a language not built for the web. My main focus was learning full-stack JavaScript and not C. When I started the course, I thought I would be able to do complete it without interference to my commitment to <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a>, which is to start the non-profit projects before the end of 2015! Sadly enough, in the past month, I haven't made much progress there either. CS50x was not in any way my reason for not being able to keep my commitment to freecodecamp, I just got distracted.
</p>
<p>So today, I decided to remove all other distractions from my JavaScript learning path and focus on learning JavaScript. For the rest of they year, I’m going to learn and practice JavaScript only. I won’t play with any other language such as C or Python.</p>
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>
So there's a few things I'll be doing to keep focused on JavaScript:
<ul>
<li> I'm going to read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a></li>
<li> I'm going to complete at least one <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a> challenge every day</li>
<li> Every week, i.e every Sunday night, I'll be posting about my progress of the previous week.</li>  
</ul>
This is it. By the end of this year, I'll have made good progress if everything goes as planned :)

<p>I’m growing tired of this!</p>

<p><em>This?</em></p>

<p>Writing this, <code class="highlighter-rouge">Hello world</code> post. This is the third time I’m writing this and this time I decided to change the title - much better, <em>don’t you think?</em></p>

<h2 id="third-time">Third Time?</h2>

<p>Since I discovered blogging in 2012, I’ve set up several blogs on various topics, and have deleted or <a href="https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199">lost them</a>. I used <a href="https://www.blogger.com">Google Blogger</a> for my first few blogs and then over the years, used many other solutions such as <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, <a href="http://modx.com/">MODX</a>, <a href="https://www.lightcms.com/">LightCMS</a>, and a lot more. Each blog had a life span of a few months. Here I’m only going to talk about the personal blogs I had/have setup:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I wrote the first one titled <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ello World</code> back when I started my personal blog in early 2015 but sadly, <a href="https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199">I lost it!</a>. My first blog was based on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and hosted for free at <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/690150.html">000WebHost</a>. The problem with this setup was that it was ad-supported and on every refresh or load an ad popped up which was annoying!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>My second blog, sadly never made it to the internet. I set it up a few weeks ago, using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and it was hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. Now Ghost isn’t natively supported on GitHub pages, as it only allows static sites and Ghost is based on <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. So, I found <a href="http://leftofnull.com/2014/02/07/using-github-pages-with-ghost-and-buster-on-windows-part-1/index.html">this post</a>, that used a set of tools to let you run Ghost on GitHub pages. Following the instructions, I successfully set up Ghost on my local machine and configured it. That is when I wrote, this post for the second time, titled <code class="highlighter-rouge">Ello World...Again</code>. I ran into a problem with Buster with that setup and after numerous tries I couldn’t fix it. I contacted the author of the post through Twitter, and I even commented on the post, but after a little back and fro, I gave up! I even got a Tweet from someone telling me the CSS on my site was broken - something I didn’t notice. So I decided to try something else.</p>

  <li>This brings us to the third and current state -  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, is built by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the same company whose service I was using to host my site so I thought you can’t get more compatible than that, right? So I started with Jekyll and ran into problems with the final site again. So I explored other popular static site generators from the list at <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>. After trying out around a dozen other options and facing the same problem, I concluded I was doing something wrong. So I Googled around, and after a little playing around with Jekyll(actually a lot playing around), I finally nailed it!</li>
</ul>

<p>Now I plan on sticking with this for a while. I don’t know for sure right now, but I will re-design the site in the future, but right now, I don’t have the time or the energy to do so.</p>

<h2 id="updates">Updates</h2>
<ul>
  <li>I’m still working through <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/ammaralishah">FreeCodeCamp</a></li>
  <li>I started <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info">Harvard CS50x</a> on edx</li>
  <li>I gave <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/chinese-language-learn-basic-mandarin-mandarinx-mx101x">learning Mandarin</a> a try but I bailed out after just one day!</li>
  <li>I got a haircut :-D</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="and">And?</h2>
<p>And that’s it. I plan on blogging regularly but I can’t say for sure right now. My High School starts from August 11 and I’m gonna try to fit blogging into my routine. I’m working on a project atm and maybe I’ll  write about that in an upcoming post/posts.</p>
