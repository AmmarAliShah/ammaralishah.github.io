Today was Day 3 of my trip.

We went to Sheikh Abad, [Mansehra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansehra) - my village.

It's a beautiful little place located in [Mansehra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mansehra).

Both of my parents grew up there and a lot of my family lives there so it was a very fun trip.

We met our family, ate(a lot) and created new memories.

Rather than just talking about Sheikh Abad, I'm going to show it to you.

*Here are the few photos I took:*
