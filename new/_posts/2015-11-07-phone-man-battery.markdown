![Focus on the battery](/../assets/battery-life.jpg)

Mobile phones have come a long way -  from clunky old devices to pocket computers. With every new release, they only get bigger and better - *better cameras, better screens, better operating systems, etc*. Phone manufacturers seem to be improving smartphones in every aspect except for one - "**The Battery**".

There are few phones out there with *good battery life* - The [Motorola Droid Maxx](http://www.gsmarena.com/motorola_droid_maxx-5604.php) is one of those few, although [I've been facing a problem with its battery](/2015/10/24/droid-maxx-battery/). Here's the thing phone manufacturers don't get: **What good is a device with a kickass screen and a great camera but which only has six hours of battery?** If I were to go review most of the the newly released phones, I'd point out one similarity between all of them - *the battery sucks*!

So this blog post is for phone manufacturers, listen up ya'll:
> We love everything you're doing with our smartphones - Give us speed, give us better screens, give us better cameras but for Gods sake, GIVE US BETTER BATTERIES!!!
