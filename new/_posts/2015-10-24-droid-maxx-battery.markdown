A few months ago, in August, I changed my smartphone and bought the [Motorola Droid Maxx](http://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones/droid-maxx/m-droid-maxx.html). I've been using the phone as my daily driver since and hadn't run into a problem with it though it was the 16-gig version and I had to do a bit of memory management but everything else was great. The great thing about this phone is that it's packed with a huge battery which is advertised to "*last for up to 48 hours on a single charge*". I'm out a lot and this battery was just what I needed. Things would've been percect if I had bought the 32-gig version but you don't get everything you wish for(and that's okay).

The last few weeks, the battery started draining really fast - 7 - 10 hours / charge. The phone also started to heat up a but if used constantly. As busy as I am, I didn't put much thought into it until yesterday when I saw that it was really turning into a problem. A full charge(which would take up to 3 hours) was draining in just 7 hours! A little CPU intensive task would raise the temperature above 40Â°C!

A quick Google search and **a lot** of forum reading gave me a lot of information:

 - I was not alone. A lot of other Droid Maxx owners were facing the same problem
 - Most people started having this problem after they upgraded to Android 4.4 - my phone came with 4.4 pre-installed
 - **The good news** - Most people were able to fix the problem by doing simple things such as re-calibrating the battery, or formatting the phone or clearing the cache

I've decided to give the *factory reset* option a try. I'll lose all my data in the process so I'm backing it all up to the cloud and my computer as I type this. Once it's done, I'll factory reset the phone and clear the cache too. I hope that'll fix the problem. If not, I'm going to try re-calibrating the battery. If all fails, I'll be contacting support but hopefully it won't come to that.
