Hey there! It's been a while since I've communicated through this method. I would tell you where or with what I've been busy but that would be a lie.

The truth is I've been doing nothing at all since my exams ended in May. I've spent the last three weeks watching the entire [How I Met Your Mother](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0460649/) show and season 6 of [Game of Thrones](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944947/). Pretty productive, right?

I did plan on writing a ton and doing a lot of other stuff, but I ended up doing none of that. I did however learn to drive which is very cool.

I also *did* try writing but it just didn't happen.

So today I finally took out some time to write this. It's not what I had in mind when I planned that I was going to write this summer but it's something at least! I also started on some code so that's a little progress in that area too. Hopefully I'll be able to publish all those article ideas I have in my notes before school starts again in August.

Also, I'm planing on starting a book on wattpad so you can follow me there for more news on that: [My Wattpad Profile](https://www.wattpad.com/user/AmmarAliShah)

Until next time, cheers!
