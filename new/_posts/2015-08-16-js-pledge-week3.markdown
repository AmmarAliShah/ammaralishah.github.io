It's Sunday night again and this marks the end of my third week for learning JavaScript. [As promised](e-learning/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x/), here's my progress for the week:

+ I read chapter 0 of [Dive into HTML5](http://diveintohtml5.info/)

+ I solved FCC Bonfire - [Check for Palindromes](http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/bonfire-check-for-palindromes);

+ I solved FCC Bonfire - [Find the Longest Word in a String](http://freecodecamp.com/challenges/bonfire-find-the-longest-word-in-a-string);

+ I started reading Eloquent JavaScript from the start again

+ I started working on a new practice website(Haven't completed it yet)

That's all I did this week. I hope I'll do better next week!
