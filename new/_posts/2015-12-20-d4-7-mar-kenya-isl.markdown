I wasn't able to post the last few days because I didn't have my laptop with me.

I'm going to write about the four days I missed.

## Day 04 to 06: Wedding

One of the main purposes of this trip was to attend my cousins wedding.

The wedding was a three day event.

The first and second day(Day 4 & 5), was in Islamabad.

The third day(Day 6), was in Abbottabad.

It was really cold and I had to wear several articles of clothing.

Don't have much to say about it except that it was nice to hang out with the **complete** family.

## Day 07: Kenya

On Day 7 I went to Kenya.

Kenya is a small village a little farther away from Mansehra.

Here's something I found out the **hard way**: *"It's a really really, really cold place."*

Yes! That cold.

It was a short trip due to the cold.

I was shivering from the cold so  didn't take many pictures.

*Here are the few photos I took:*
