I discovered podcasts almost two years ago and got addicted to them. I would listen to them all the time and was subscribed to like a hundred different ones, but slowly I started losing interest  and now I only listen to a few.

Psychobabble is a podcast I recently discovered and fell in love with.

Wikipedia defines Psychobabble as:

> Psychobabble is a form of speech or writing that uses psychological jargon, buzzwords, and esoteric language to create an impression of truth or plausibility.

The podcast, hosted by YouTube stars [Tyler Oakley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyler_Oakley) and [Korey Kuhl](https://twitter.com/koreykuhl), is about Pop culture and Holywood gossip. The two best friends take you through a number of topics in the thirty minutes to one hour duration of the show. In one of the episodes, the hosts tell us that the idea behind this podcast was to turn the listener into their third BFF and just gossip around. Well, if that was the idea, then mission accomplished!

The podcast also has a side where they give out advice to listeners who email them their questions. That's a very cool feature too considering that a lot of kids consider such internet personalities to be their role models and what could be better than sharing your problems with them.

The podcast itself is great as you're promised stories that you've never heard in videos and listening to the podcast gives you a hangout kind of feeling so it's great to listen to.

You can listen to the podcast on [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/psychobabbletyleroakley) or [iTunes](https://exit.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fitunes.com%2Fpsychobabble). Let me know what you think in the comments or on Twitter [@AmmarAliShahK](https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK).
