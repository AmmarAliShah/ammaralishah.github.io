Today was Day 8 of my trip.

We went to [Havelian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Havelian), to visit my cousin.

While my family sat in their house sipping tea and talking, I set out with my cousin to explore Havelian.

I took a walk around the place.

I was pleasantly surprised as the small looking town is much larger than it seems.

It has it's own little Railway Station.

A relatively large bazaar too.

I wasn't able to take any pictures though!

After eating dinner, I returned to Abbottabad.

This was Day 8. Let's see where I go to tomorrow.
