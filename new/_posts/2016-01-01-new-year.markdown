Look at the calendar.

Look at the clock.

**It's 2016!**

2015 is behind us and now 2016 is where we stand.

The page has turned and has given us yet another year to improve our lives and the lives of others around us.

If you have nothing else to be grateful for, just be grateful that you have been given the chance to live another day.

Let's take a look back on 2015:

## A look back on 2015

For me, *2015 was the year of change.*

Now you may say that, **"Ammar, that's every year"** but just hang on for a second.

Let's take a look at what I'm talking about:

 + I joined the Free Code Camp team! An amazing experience. I got to work remotely as a team with people from all over the globe. Working on something I actually believe.

 + I got into Open-Source development.

 + [I started this blog](/2015/07/10/so-it-begins/)

 + I started and [left CS50x](/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x//).

 + I got done with my CIEs.

 + I switched schools.

 + I joined [Zidisha](https://www.zidisha.org/), yet another non-profit.

 + [I named this blog](/2015/10/25/ammar-says/)

 + [I completed a year at Free Code Camp](/2015/12/01/year-at-fcc/)

 + [I travelled in a train and I went on a Winter Trip and blogged about it, turning this blog into a travel blog](/2015/12/12/isl-trip/).

 + AND, [I wrote **22** blog posts](http://ammaralishah.github.io/archive/).

 I could write a lot more changes but these are the main ones that mean something to me.

 It's been an amazing year and I've done so much. :))

 ## 2016?

 Well that was my 2015.

 Let's hope 2016 brings even more exciting things in life, *because if life isn't exciting, what is it?*

 Happy New Year to you all and I hope it is an exciting year for you all!
