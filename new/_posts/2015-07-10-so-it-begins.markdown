![Hello World](/../assets/hello-world.png)

I'm growing tired of this! *This?* Writing this, `Hello world` post. This is the third time I'm writing this and this time I decided to change the title - much better, *don't you think?*

## Third Time?

 Since I discovered blogging in 2012, I've set up several blogs on various topics, and have deleted or [lost them](https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199). I used [Google Blogger](https://www.blogger.com) for my first few blogs and then over the years, used many other solutions such as [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/), [WordPress.org](https://wordpress.org/), [Ghost](https://ghost.org/), [MODX](http://modx.com/), [LightCMS](https://www.lightcms.com/), and a lot more. Each blog had a life span of a few months. Here I'm only going to talk about the personal blogs I had/have setup:

 + I wrote the first one titled `Ello World` back when I started my personal blog in early 2015 but sadly, [I lost it!](https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199). My first blog was based on [WordPress](https://wordpress.org/) and hosted for free at [000WebHost](http://www.000webhost.com/690150.html). The problem with this setup was that it was ad-supported and on every refresh or load an ad popped up which was annoying!  

 + My second blog, sadly never made it to the internet. I set it up a few weeks ago, using [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) and it was hosted on [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/). Now Ghost isn't natively supported on GitHub pages, as it only allows static sites and Ghost is based on [node.js](https://nodejs.org/). So, I found [this post](http://leftofnull.com/2014/02/07/using-github-pages-with-ghost-and-buster-on-windows-part-1/index.html), that used a set of tools to let you run Ghost on GitHub pages. Following the instructions, I successfully set up Ghost on my local machine and configured it. That is when I wrote, this post for the second time, titled `Ello World...Again`. I ran into a problem with Buster with that setup and after numerous tries I couldn't fix it. I contacted the author of the post through Twitter, and I even commented on the post, but after a little back and fro, I gave up! I even got a Tweet from someone telling me the CSS on my site was broken - something I didn't notice. So I decided to try something else.
 <blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">@AmmarAliShahK</a> I think your CSS is broken on your website <a href="http://t.co/bXAJwIDRpm">http://t.co/bXAJwIDRpm</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Harames (@MatthewHarames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewHarames/status/617758469584654336">July 5, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

 + This brings us to the third and current state -  [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), is built by [GitHub](https://github.com/), the same company whose service I was using to host my site so I thought you can't get more compatible than that, right? So I started with Jekyll and ran into problems with the final site again. So I explored other popular static site generators from the list at [StaticGen](https://www.staticgen.com/). After trying out around a dozen other options and facing the same problem, I concluded I was doing something wrong. So I Googled around, and after a little playing around with Jekyll(actually a lot playing around), I finally nailed it!

 Now I plan on sticking with this for a while. I don't know for sure right now, but I will re-design the site in the future, but right now, I don't have the time or the energy to do so.

## Updates
+ I'm still working through [FreeCodeCamp](http://www.freecodecamp.com/ammaralishah)
+ I started [Harvard CS50x](https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info) on edx
+ I gave [learning Mandarin](https://www.edx.org/course/chinese-language-learn-basic-mandarin-mandarinx-mx101x) a try but I bailed out after just one day!
+ I got a haircut :-D

## And?
And that's it. I plan on blogging regularly but I can't say for sure right now. My High School starts from August 11 and I'm gonna try to fit blogging into my routine. I'm working on a project atm and maybe I'll  write about that in an upcoming post/posts.
