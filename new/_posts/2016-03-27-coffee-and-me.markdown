![Coffee and Me](https://static.pexels.com/photos/6347/coffee-cup-working-happy.jpg)

I've always had a weird relationship with coffee.

As soon as I finish a cup, I'm going to get sleepy - *really* sleepy! I won't be able to keep my eyes open and if I lie down, I'll fall asleep. It has the exact opposite effect on me, **but**, around an hour later, It'll work it's magic - I'll be wide awake, unable to sleep.

I had Coffee around 9PM. As soon as I gulped it down, like some kind of immediate effecting drug you see in the movies, I started getting sleepy. So much sleepy that I dropped my phone from my hand. At 10PM, again like the previous pill but with the exact opposite effect, I'm wide awake. No more yawning, no more of my eyes closing, no more of dropping my phone because I dozed off for a second.

Now I'm awake - *wide awake*.

It's 2:31AM as I write this. I woke up at 6AM the previous day, like I do everyday ( I don't know why, I just do! ). I've had only about 6 hours of sleep in the last 25 hours ( approximately ).

I have two ways to go to sleep right now, have another cup of coffee so that I fall asleep instantly and wake up at 6 ( in about 4 hours), or I just wait for sweet sweet sleep to come while I read article after article online. I could also execute both of them but I don't want to end up sleeping with my head on my keyboard ( it isn't very comfortable )

Either way, I'm going to end up sleeping *somewhere* and *somehow* but I'll still be up at 6AM. I don't really know why, but my body refuses to sleep after that time. It's still a mystery to me why this happens and if any one of you is a professional in this field ( or just knowledgeable ), feel free to discuss this with me in the comments below or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK).
