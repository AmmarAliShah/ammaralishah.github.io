If you follow me on Twitter, *which you probably don't*, but if you do, you must have spotted something I tweeted out a few days ago:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">It&#39;s final - I&#39;m going to Islamabad in a week ☺☺</p>&mdash; Ammar Ali Shah (@AmmarAliShahK) <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK/status/672624888742551552">December 4, 2015</a></blockquote>

I'm going to [Islamabad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Islamabad) on Sunday(Dec 14) i.e Tomorrow Night!!!

It'll be roughly around a two weeks trip and I'll be back in Karachi before the end of the year(hopefully).

The main reason for the journey is to attend my cousin's weeding who is FINALLY getting married next week.

*Congratulations to him! :))*

I'm really excited to go because I get to travel in a train for the journey and I haven't been on a train since about 10 or 12 years!

On the other hand, I'm a bit scared that I won't be able to bear the cold.

Oh well!

I guess I'll find out!
