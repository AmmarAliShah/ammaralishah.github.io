Today was Day 1 of my trip.

The day was almost completely spent in the train.

In a [previous post](/2015/12/12/isl-trip/), I wrote that I was really excited to finally travel in a train after almost ten years.

Well, I have to say I was rightly excited as the train ride was really fun though a bit long and tedious.

Well, first a shout-out to the Green Line Express team.

The service was great.

Our small little Train cabin had a TV, WiFi and blankets.

Though nothing was perfect(the WiFi didn't work for 99% of the journey and the pillows were hard to sleep on), it still was a reasonably comfortable journey given that the train was very punctual.

I wasn't able to [tweet](https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK) or ['scope](https://www.periscope.tv/AmmarAliShahK) from the train like I had planned to but oh well.

After an almost 22-hour train ride, I finally stepped out of the train ready to face the cold winter air of Rawalpindi.

My cousins house was in Islamabad and not in Rawalpindi and so we had to take a short ride in a car to get to their place.

Half an hour later, I was sitting with my cousins and family at their house in Islamabad.

Time to sleep now.

I need to rest to get ready for Day 2!
