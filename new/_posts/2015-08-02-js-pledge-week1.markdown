So I recently [quit CS50x](/e-learning/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x.html) and in that post I stated I'd be writing about my progress every week till the end of the year. Well it's Sunday and my time is up and as stated, this is y first weekly report. This week wasn't as productive as I thought it would be due to some family events. I had to spend three complete days away from my house and computer(Wednesday, Friday and Sunday) so that put me a little behind on my progress.

+ I completed [Free Code Camp Waypoint: Learn regular expressions](http://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/waypoint-learn-regular-expressions)

+ I read [chapter 4](http://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html) from [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net)

+ Completed "[The sum of a range](https://github.com/AmmarAliShah/EloquentJavaScript-Solutions/blob/master/04_01.%20The%20sum%20of%20a%20range.js)" exercise from [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net)

+ Completed [Introduction to HTML](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/introduction-to-html-2897) at [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com)

+ Completed [Introduction to Responsive Web Design](https://www.sitepoint.com/premium/courses/introduction-to-responsive-web-design-2889) at [Sitepoint](https://www.sitepoint.com)

+ Completed [Build Your First Website: Getting Started with HTML & CSS](/cert.jpg?raw=true) at [Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/)

That's all for this week. I know it's not much but I'll try improving next week. The whole point of this pledge is to track my progress and try to improve little by little every week.
