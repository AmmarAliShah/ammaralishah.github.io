    Today was Day 10 of my trip. I wasn’t able to write yesterday so this post will cover that too! So Day 9 &amp; 10 were spent in Sheikhabad. This was my second visit to Sheikhabad for this trip. The first one was a bit short. This trip was a bit longer than the last one. We stayed there for almost two days. This time it rained too! I did a bit of exploring this...<br>

    Today was Day 8 of my trip. We went to Havelian, to visit my cousin. While my family sat in their house sipping tea and talking, I set out with my cousin to explore Havelian. I took a walk around the place. I was pleasantly surprised as the small looking town is much larger than it seems. It has it’s own little Railway Station. A relatively large bazaar too. I wasn’t able to take any...<br>

    I wasn’t able to post the last few days because I didn’t have my laptop with me. I’m going to write about the four days I missed. Day 04 to 06: Wedding One of the main purposes of this trip was to attend my cousins wedding. The wedding was a three day event. The first and second day(Day 4 &amp; 5), was in Islamabad. The third day(Day 6), was in Abbottabad. It was really cold...<br>

    Today was Day 3 of my trip. We went to Sheikh Abad, Mansehra - my village. It’s a beautiful little place located in Mansehra. Both of my parents grew up there and a lot of my family lives there so it was a very fun trip. We met our family, ate(a lot) and created new memories. Rather than just talking about Sheikh Abad, I’m going to show it to you. Here are the few photos...<br>

    <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2015</span>
    Today was Day 2 of my trip. I woke up to a very, very cold Islamabad morning. Though I was really tired from the long train ride, I got up at 8 AM. After breakfast we started to get ready to leave for Abbottabad. That’s right! After travelling in a train for 22 hours, we were setting out once again for a 3-hour journey by car to Abbottabad. We left around 2:30 PM and reached,...<br>
