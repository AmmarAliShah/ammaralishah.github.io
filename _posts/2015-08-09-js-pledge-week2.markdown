It's been 2 weeks since I took my [JavaScript pledge](e-learning/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x/) and it's Sunday night which means time for my weekly report. This week wasn't productive at all and I did even worse than [last time](/code/2015/08/02/js-pledge-week1/).

+ I read Chapter 5 of Eloquent JavaScript

+ I read Learn HTML & CSS by Shay Howe

+ I built a practice website(HTML & CSS)

+ Solved the "reverse an array" challenge

That's all I did this week. I hope I'll do better next week!
