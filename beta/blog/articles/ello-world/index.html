          <section class="content"><p>I write this in a Chrome window that is taking up about 50% of my screen. What’s on the other 50% you ask? It’s <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text 2</a>. I’m not a fan of Sublime Text, nor do I use it everyday. I’m more of a <a href="http://brackets.io/">Brackets</a> kind of guy, but I have Sublime open right now because I’m writing some <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> code and I like to use Sublime Text for it. I don’t know why but I just write my Python code in Sublime Text. I even found this new shortcut just now that let’s you run the code in a console directly inside of Sublime. It’s <em>Ctrl + B</em>. Now I don’t have to fire up the terminal to see the result of my code, I can view it directly inside of Sublime. Another reason to use Sublime for Python.

<p>Now that’s enough of what I’m doing right now. This post is technically my first post for this blog. My first post could have been months ago when I actually set up this blog but I never got time to write one. I didn’t even have time to design a website for myself. <strong>My website sits empty with a Coming Soon page</strong>. I have a copy of the old designs, but I just don’t want to put them back up. I’m going to build a new one as soon as I get time but in the meantime, I can still use this blog. I’m running it on WordPress and I didn’t even bother with the styling. I want this blog to be simple and just serve it’s purpose, i.e.  to deliver what I write to you - that’s what blogs are&nbsp;for.</p>

<p>If your thinking something along the lines of: “Oh God, this guy goes on and on and on…”, I would suggest you stop reading this right now! The only reason I started a blog was so that I could portrait my thoughts to the world and if you have a problem with it, just close the tab(Ctrl + W) and don’t come&nbsp;back.</p>
<p>Since you did stick around to read the rest of this, I hope you stick around to read my up coming posts. As easy as I made it sound, I had a few problems with setting up this blog and I’ll be talking about them in my next post. Till then, have&nbsp;fun!</p>
