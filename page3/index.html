    Today was Day 3 of my trip. We went to Sheikh Abad, Mansehra - my village. It’s a beautiful little place located in Mansehra. Both of my parents grew up there and a lot of my family lives there so it was a very fun trip. We met our family, ate(a lot) and created new memories. Rather than just talking about Sheikh Abad, I’m going to show it to you. Here are the few photos...<br>

    <span class="post-date">15 Dec 2015</span>
    Today was Day 2 of my trip. I woke up to a very, very cold Islamabad morning. Though I was really tired from the long train ride, I got up at 8 AM. After breakfast we started to get ready to leave for Abbottabad. That’s right! After travelling in a train for 22 hours, we were setting out once again for a 3-hour journey by car to Abbottabad. We left around 2:30 PM and reached,...<br>

    <span class="post-date">14 Dec 2015</span>
    Today was Day 1 of my trip. The day was almost completely spent in the train. In a previous post, I wrote that I was really excited to finally travel in a train after almost ten years. Well, I have to say I was rightly excited as the train ride was really fun though a bit long and tedious. Well, first a shout-out to the Green Line Express team. The service was great. Our small...<br>

    <span class="post-date">13 Dec 2015</span>
    Due to lack of time and Internet(and partly due to the cold weather), this post went up a day late. I’ve sent out tweets and wrote a blog post about it. Yes I’m talking about going to Islamabad. I’m going to leave in a few hours, but before I go, I thought I should share my bag pack with you. Now this is not my only bag. I’ve got three more bags(!!). This is my...<br>

    If you follow me on Twitter, which you probably don’t, but if you do, you must have spotted something I tweeted out a few days ago: It&#39;s final - I&#39;m going to Islamabad in a week ☺☺&mdash; Ammar Ali Shah (@AmmarAliShahK) December 4, 2015 I’m going to Islamabad on Sunday(Dec 14) i.e Tomorrow Night!!!
