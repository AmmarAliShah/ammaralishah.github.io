    Today was Day 13 of my trip - the final day! I wasn’t able to post the last two days because my laptop messed up. Here’s what happened: Windows 10 messed up! My system wouldn’t boot! I sat down to write about my day but windows 10 wasn’t agreeing with me. I tried again and again, but after an hour, I decided to go to bed and write in the morning. If you follow me...<br>

    Today was Day 10 of my trip. I wasn’t able to write yesterday so this post will cover that too! So Day 9 &amp; 10 were spent in Sheikhabad. This was my second visit to Sheikhabad for this trip. The first one was a bit short. This trip was a bit longer than the last one. We stayed there for almost two days. This time it rained too! I did a bit of exploring this...<br>

    Today was Day 8 of my trip. We went to Havelian, to visit my cousin. While my family sat in their house sipping tea and talking, I set out with my cousin to explore Havelian. I took a walk around the place. I was pleasantly surprised as the small looking town is much larger than it seems. It has it’s own little Railway Station. A relatively large bazaar too. I wasn’t able to take any...<br>

    I wasn’t able to post the last few days because I didn’t have my laptop with me. I’m going to write about the four days I missed. Day 04 to 06: Wedding One of the main purposes of this trip was to attend my cousins wedding. The wedding was a three day event. The first and second day(Day 4 &amp; 5), was in Islamabad. The third day(Day 6), was in Abbottabad. It was really cold...<br>

    Today was Day 3 of my trip. We went to Sheikh Abad, Mansehra - my village. It’s a beautiful little place located in Mansehra. Both of my parents grew up there and a lot of my family lives there so it was a very fun trip. We met our family, ate(a lot) and created new memories. Rather than just talking about Sheikh Abad, I’m going to show it to you. Here are the few photos...<br>
