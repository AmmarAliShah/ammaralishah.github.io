    This may be the first meaningful thing I&#39;m writing on this blog! Let&#39;s meet Ellie Ellie Adam is a designer and web developer based in Seattle, Washington. I met Ellie through Free Code Camp, where she was on the volunteer team with me. Ellie did some design work for Free Code Camp and that&#39;s how I knew about her skills. The Favor I started a blog called The Worm Official in 2014. A few months...<br>

        Phone Manufacturers: Focus on the battery
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Nov 2015</span>
    Mobile phones have come a long way - from clunky old devices to pocket computers. With every new release, they only get bigger and better - better cameras, better screens, better operating systems, etc. Phone manufacturers seem to be improving smartphones in every aspect except for one - &quot;The Battery&quot;. There are few phones out there with good battery life - The Motorola Droid Maxx is one of those few, although I&#39;ve been facing a...<br>

    I write this listening to Hero by Family of the Year. It&#39;s an amazing song and you should listen to it. I first heard it while watching, Boyhood, a few days ago. I don&#39;t always listen to music when I&#39;m writing but I&#39;m addicted to Hero right now. This post isn&#39;t about the song, nor is it about Boyhood - it could be, but it isn&#39;t. This post is actually about my blog, this blog...<br>

    <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2015</span>
    A few months ago, in August, I changed my smartphone and bought the Motorola Droid Maxx. I&#39;ve been using the phone as my daily driver since and hadn&#39;t run into a problem with it though it was the 16-gig version and I had to do a bit of memory management but everything else was great. The great thing about this phone is that it&#39;s packed with a huge battery which is advertised to &quot;last for...<br>
