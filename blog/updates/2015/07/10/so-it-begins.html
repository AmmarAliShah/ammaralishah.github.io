  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I’m growing tired of this! <em>This?</em> Writing this <code>Hello world</code> post. I’m writing it for the third time now and this time, I wanted
to change the title from my classic <code>Ello World</code>, and so I changed it to this - much better don’t you think?</p>

<h3>Writing it for the third time?</h3>
<p>Yeah. I wrote the first one titled <code>Ello World</code> back when I started my blog in early 2015 but sadly, <a href="https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199">I lost it!</a>. My first blog was based on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and hosted for free at <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/690150.html">000WebHost</a>. The problem with this setup was that it was ad-supported and on every refresh or load an ad popped up which was annoying!</p>

<p>My second blog, sadly never made it to the internet. I set it up a few weeks ago, using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and it was hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. Now Ghost isn’t natively supported on GitHub pages, as it only allows static sites and Ghost is based on <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. So, I found <a href="http://leftofnull.com/2014/02/07/using-github-pages-with-ghost-and-buster-on-windows-part-1/index.html">this post</a>, that used a set of tools to let you run Ghost on GitHub pages. Following the instructions, I successfully set up Ghost locally on my computer and configured it. That is when I wrote, this post for the second time, titled <code>Ello World...Again</code>. I ran into a problem with Buster with that setup and after numerous tries I couldn’t fix it. I contacted the author of the post through Twitter, and I even commented on the post, but after a little back and fro, I gave up! I even got a Tweet from someone telling me the CSS on my site was broken - something I didn’t notice. So I decided to try something else.</p>

<p><img src="http://ammaralishah.me/assets/siteBrokenTweet.jpg" alt="The Tweet I got" /></p>

<p>This brings us to my third and current state, <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. Jekyll, is built by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the same company whose service I was using to host my site so I thought you can’t get more compatible than that, right? So I started with Jekyll and ran into problems with the final site again. So I explored other popular static site generators from the list at <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>. After trying out around a dozen other options and facing the same problem, I concluded I was doing something wrong. So I Googled around, and after a little playing around with Jekyll(actually a lot playing around), I finally nailed it!</p>

<h3>So now what?</h3>
<p>Now I plan on sticking with this for a while. I don’t know for sure right now, but I will re-designt the site in the future, but right now, I don’t have the time or the energy to do so.</p>

<h3>Updates</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I’m still working through <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp</a></li>
  <li>I started <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info">Harvard CS50x</a> on edx</li>
  <li>I gave learning Mandarin a try but I bailed out after just one day!</li>
  <li>I got a haircut :-D</li>
</ul>

<h3>And?</h3>
<p>And that’s it. I plan on blogging regularly but I can’t say for sure right now. My college starts from August and I’m gonna try to fit blogging into my routine. Till then, I’m working on a <em>non-profit</em> project atm(not from FreeCodeCamp) and I’ll be writing about that in an upcoming post/posts.</p>
