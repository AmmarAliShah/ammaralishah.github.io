  <h1 class="post-title">Droid Maxx Battery problems</h1>
  <span class="post-date">24 Oct 2015</span>

<p>A few months ago, in August, I changed my smartphone and bought the <a href="http://www.motorola.com/us/smartphones/droid-maxx/m-droid-maxx.html">Motorola Droid Maxx</a>. I&#39;ve been using the phone as my daily driver since and hadn&#39;t run into a problem with it though it was the 16-gig version and I had to do a bit of memory management but everything else was great. The great thing about this phone is that it&#39;s packed with a huge battery which is advertised to &quot;<em>last for up to 48 hours on a single charge</em>&quot;. I&#39;m out a lot and this battery was just what I needed. Things would&#39;ve been percect if I had bought the 32-gig version but you don&#39;t get everything you wish for(and that&#39;s okay).</p>

<p><img src="/../assets/DroidMaxx1.png" alt="Droid Maxx Battery"></p>

<p>The last few weeks, the battery started draining really fast - 7 - 10 hours / charge. The phone also started to heat up a but if used constantly. As busy as I am, I didn&#39;t put much thought into it until yesterday when I saw that it was really turning into a problem. A full charge(which would take up to 3 hours) was draining in just 7 hours! A little CPU intensive task would raise the temperature above 40Â°C!</p>

<p>A quick Google search and <strong>a lot</strong> of forum reading gave me a lot of information:</p>

<ul>
<li>I was not alone. A lot of other Droid Maxx owners were facing the same problem</li>
<li>Most people started having this problem after they upgraded to Android 4.4 - my phone came with 4.4 pre-installed</li>
<li><strong>The good news</strong> - Most people were able to fix the problem by doing simple things such as re-calibrating the battery, or formatting the phone or clearing the cache</li>
</ul>

<p>I&#39;ve decided to give the <em>factory reset</em> option a try. I&#39;ll lose all my data in the process so I&#39;m backing it all up to the cloud and my computer as I type this. Once it&#39;s done, I&#39;ll factory reset the phone and clear the cache too. I hope that&#39;ll fix the problem. If not, I&#39;m going to try re-calibrating the battery. If all fails, I&#39;ll be contacting support but hopefully it won&#39;t come to that.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve made small changes to the blog. I&#39;m trying things out and once I think everything is the way I want it to be, I&#39;ll be writing a post about the changes and explaining what I did and why I did it.</p>
