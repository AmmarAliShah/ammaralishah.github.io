  <span class="post-date">25 Oct 2015</span>
  <p>I write this listening to <a href="http://www.deezer.com/track/76983689?utm_source=deezer&amp;utm_content=track-76983689&amp;utm_term=793525815_1445720257&amp;utm_medium=web">Hero by Family of the Year</a>. It&#39;s an amazing song and you should listen to it. I first heard it while watching, <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1065073/">Boyhood</a>, a few days ago. I don&#39;t always listen to music when I&#39;m writing but I&#39;m addicted to Hero right now.  This post isn&#39;t about the song, nor is it about Boyhood - it could be, but it isn&#39;t.  This post is actually about my blog, <em>this blog</em> which I&#39;ve made some changes to.</p>

<h2>Why the change?</h2>

<p>Before I start with what has changed, I want to explain my plan to you all. As I <a href="/2015/07/10/so-it-begins/">stated before</a>, I&#39;ve been blogging since 2012 because I love writing and sharing my thought with all of you. In 2014, I started <a href="http://thewormofficial.wordpress.com/">The Worm official</a> and wrote a few posts there. I spent the last few months building <a href="http://thewormofficial.github.io/">a new home for The Worm Official</a>. The last few weeks have been very tense for me as I was trying to decide a few things. Here&#39;s a list of what I concluded:</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;ll be shutting down The Worm Official but the old site will still be up as an archive.</li>
<li>My focus will be on writing on this blog.</li>
<li>Since I like to talk on a lot of topics, I will not be limiting this blog to a specific topic.</li>
</ul>

<p>As hard as it was for me, I&#39;ve closed  &quot;The Worm Official chapter&quot; in my life and will soon be deleting it&#39;s social accounts. This gives me time to focus more on this blog. I&#39;ll be writing here completely from now on. As mentioned above, I will not be following a specific topic. I still haven&#39;t decided the frequency of my posts but I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll decide that too at some point in the near future. Now that that&#39;s done, here&#39;s what has changed:</p>

<h3>Blog Name</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve decided to name this blog, &quot;<strong>Ammar Says</strong>&quot;. The tagline accompanying this name is &quot;<strong>Freshly Published Thoughts on the world!</strong>&quot;. <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">Let me know</a> your thoughts on the name and tagline - I promise I don&#39;t bite!</p>

<h3>Sidebar(Top on mobile)</h3>

<p>I&#39;ve also made some changes to the side/top nav of the site. On every page, you&#39;ll see the description changes. I just thought it looked good. <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">What do you think?</a></p>

<h3>Writing Archive</h3>

<p>I also added in a <a href="/writing/">writing archive</a>. It lists all my posts that are available online.</p>

<h3>Social Sharing Buttons</h3>

<p>If you scroll down a bit, you&#39;ll notice a social sharing bar appears. I&#39;ve disabled it on mobile so that the experience is smooth. Do you like it? Do you hate it? Do you find it annoying? <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">Tell me</a>.</p>

<hr>

<p>That&#39;s everything I&#39;ve changed visually. I also made a few changes that don&#39;t really effect your experience so there&#39;s no point in talking about that. I care a lot about User Experience and that&#39;s why I want you to <a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">tell me</a> about your experience because I care about you :))</p>
