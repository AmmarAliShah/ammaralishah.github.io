  <p>After a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/cs50/permalink/562182657262117/">long debate</a>, this post has been updated with more details</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A few weeks ago, as mentioned in my <a href="/updates/2015/07/10/so-it-begins.html">previous post</a>, I started Harvards famous Computer Science MOOC, <a href="http://cs50.harvard.edu/">CS50</a>, on <a href="&quot;https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">edx</a>. Now by the time you’ll reach Week 1, you’ll know why this course is so famous - Hint: It’s the teacher. <a href="https://twitter.com/davidjmalan">David</a> is the reason for CS50s success. He’s very energetic and easily steals the attention of his audience. He is the second <em>teacher</em> who has inspired me, the first one being, <a href="http://simonallardice.com/">Simon Allardice</a>. Now back to CS50.</p>

<p>I joined CS50</p>

<p>
In my <a href="/updates/2015/07/10/so-it-begins.html">previous post</a>, I mentioned I started <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/introduction-computer-science-harvardx-cs50x">Harvards CS50</a> on edx. Today, I decided to quit it and I un-enrolled from the class on edx. I made the decision after thinking on it long and hard so I'm not regretting what I did. Here's why I quit:
</p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>
To sum it up in a line, <em>I didn't have time for it</em>. I'm a web developer meaning what I do is related to the web - websites and web-apps. The course teaches C, a language not built for the web. My main focus was learning full-stack JavaScript and not C. When I started the course, I thought I would be able to do complete it without interference to my commitment to <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a>, which is to start the non-profit projects before the end of 2015! Sadly enough, in the past month, I haven't made much progress there either. CS50x was not in any way my reason for not being able to keep my commitment to freecodecamp, I just got distracted.
</p>
So today, I decided to remove all other distractions from my JavaScript learning path and focus on learning JavaScript. For the rest of they year, I'm going to learn and practice JavaScript only. I won't play with any other language such as C or Python.
<h2>Aftermath</h2>
<p>
So there's a few things I'll be doing to keep focused on JavaScript:
<ul>
<li> I'm going to read <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a></li>
<li> I'm going to complete at least one <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/">Free Code Camp</a> challenge every day</li>
<li> Every week, i.e every Sunday night, I'll be posting about my progress of the previous week.</li>  
</ul>
This is it. By the end of this year, I'll have made good progress if everything goes as planned :)
