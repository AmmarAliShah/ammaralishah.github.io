  <p><img src="/../assets/hello-world.png" alt="Hello World"></p>

<p>I&#39;m growing tired of this! <em>This?</em> Writing this, <code>Hello world</code> post. This is the third time I&#39;m writing this and this time I decided to change the title - much better, <em>don&#39;t you think?</em></p>

<h2>Third Time?</h2>

<p>Since I discovered blogging in 2012, I&#39;ve set up several blogs on various topics, and have deleted or <a href="https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199">lost them</a>. I used <a href="https://www.blogger.com">Google Blogger</a> for my first few blogs and then over the years, used many other solutions such as <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>, <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress.org</a>, <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a>, <a href="http://modx.com/">MODX</a>, <a href="https://www.lightcms.com/">LightCMS</a>, and a lot more. Each blog had a life span of a few months. Here I&#39;m only going to talk about the personal blogs I had/have setup:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>I wrote the first one titled <code>Ello World</code> back when I started my personal blog in early 2015 but sadly, <a href="https://medium.com/@ammarshah/how-i-lost-my-blog-24b31e300199">I lost it!</a>. My first blog was based on <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> and hosted for free at <a href="http://www.000webhost.com/690150.html">000WebHost</a>. The problem with this setup was that it was ad-supported and on every refresh or load an ad popped up which was annoying!  </p></li>
<li><p>My second blog, sadly never made it to the internet. I set it up a few weeks ago, using <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> and it was hosted on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub pages</a>. Now Ghost isn&#39;t natively supported on GitHub pages, as it only allows static sites and Ghost is based on <a href="https://nodejs.org/">node.js</a>. So, I found <a href="http://leftofnull.com/2014/02/07/using-github-pages-with-ghost-and-buster-on-windows-part-1/index.html">this post</a>, that used a set of tools to let you run Ghost on GitHub pages. Following the instructions, I successfully set up Ghost on my local machine and configured it. That is when I wrote, this post for the second time, titled <code>Ello World...Again</code>. I ran into a problem with Buster with that setup and after numerous tries I couldn&#39;t fix it. I contacted the author of the post through Twitter, and I even commented on the post, but after a little back and fro, I gave up! I even got a Tweet from someone telling me the CSS on my site was broken - something I didn&#39;t notice. So I decided to try something else.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://twitter.com/AmmarAliShahK">@AmmarAliShahK</a> I think your CSS is broken on your website <a href="http://t.co/bXAJwIDRpm">http://t.co/bXAJwIDRpm</a></p>&mdash; Matthew Harames (@MatthewHarames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MatthewHarames/status/617758469584654336">July 5, 2015</a></blockquote>
<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p></li>
<li><p>This brings us to the third and current state -  <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, is built by <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>, the same company whose service I was using to host my site so I thought you can&#39;t get more compatible than that, right? So I started with Jekyll and ran into problems with the final site again. So I explored other popular static site generators from the list at <a href="https://www.staticgen.com/">StaticGen</a>. After trying out around a dozen other options and facing the same problem, I concluded I was doing something wrong. So I Googled around, and after a little playing around with Jekyll(actually a lot playing around), I finally nailed it!</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Now I plan on sticking with this for a while. I don&#39;t know for sure right now, but I will re-design the site in the future, but right now, I don&#39;t have the time or the energy to do so.</p>

<h2>Updates</h2>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m still working through <a href="http://www.freecodecamp.com/ammaralishah">FreeCodeCamp</a></li>
<li>I started <a href="https://courses.edx.org/courses/HarvardX/CS50x3/2015/info">Harvard CS50x</a> on edx</li>
<li>I gave <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/chinese-language-learn-basic-mandarin-mandarinx-mx101x">learning Mandarin</a> a try but I bailed out after just one day!</li>
<li>I got a haircut :-D</li>
</ul>

<h2>And?</h2>

<p>And that&#39;s it. I plan on blogging regularly but I can&#39;t say for sure right now. My High School starts from August 11 and I&#39;m gonna try to fit blogging into my routine. I&#39;m working on a project atm and maybe I&#39;ll  write about that in an upcoming post/posts.</p>
