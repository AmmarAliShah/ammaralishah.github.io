<p>The time has come for me to admit my crimes:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I haven&#39;t been loyal to this blog and to the people who read it. In my <a href="http://ammaralishah.me/2015/07/10/so-it-begins/">very first post</a>, I promised I would fall into some kind of regularity of blogging after I start High School. A few weeks after that, when <a href="http://ammaralishah.me/2015/07/25/leaving-cs50x/">I quit CS50</a>, I made yet another promise that I would post about my code journey every week. I haven&#39;t been able to fulfill either of those promises :-(</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Phew!</em> Good thing I got that off my chest, I can sleep peacefully now. Am I done here then? Not quite... being the nice guy I am, I&#39;m going to tell you exactly why I haven&#39;t been able to keep my promises, or in-other-words, I&#39;m going to play the blame game :))</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR I blame my High School</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As <a href="http://ammaralishah.me/2015/07/10/so-it-begins/">mentioned before</a>, I started High School in the second week of August and had to adjust to my new schedule. Turns out, It&#39;s practically impossible to do so. I leave for school at around 7 AM and return around 4 PM. By the time I change, shower and eat, It&#39;s already over 5 PM. By the time I&#39;m back to functioning properly, it&#39;s over 7 PM and I have to start doing my homework which take two hours(yes they are trying to kill us). By 10 PM, I&#39;m exhausted and just fall asleep. That&#39;s my routine Monday through Friday. Hopefully this will earn me your sympathy and you&#39;ll let me go for not keeping my promise.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>TL;DR  I found better ways to track my progress while being productive</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that I&#39;ve laid out the practical impossibility of a blogging routine, I&#39;m going to tell you about my weekends. Judging from my daily schedule, you might argue that I had time to write my weekly report on weekends, and you&#39;re absolutely right. I could have written the weekly report, but I didn&#39;t. At first, I forgot writing it every Sunday night and later on, I realized it was just another burden on me. I only had two free days every week and I could either be productive or worry about everything else I have to do. So I just made rough notes of what I did that day and decided to turn them into real posts later on(which I never did). <strong>So I&#39;ve just decided to quit writing my weekly report</strong>. The only reason I was writing them was to track my progress right, well FCC, GitHub and other tools I use are already doing that!</p>

<p>FreeCodeCamp does a great job of tracking my daily progress so I don&#39;t need to track it myself,</p>

<p><img src="/../assets/FCC.JPG" alt="FreeCodeCamp progress"></p>

<p>and so does GitHub.</p>

<p><img src="/../assets/GHprog.JPG" alt="GitHub tracking"></p>

<p>That frees me of the responsibly to track my progress and I can focus more on learning to code.</p>

<p>By now, I expect you warm-hearted people have forgiven me for not keeping my word and sympathies with me and my class fellows and are going to spam <a href="http://commecscollege.edu.pk/">my school</a> about the horrific timings. If that is the case, here&#39;s <a href="mailto:info@commecscollege.edu.pk">their email</a>.</p>

<p>So basically this posts <em>officially</em> announces my previous promises are now no longer valid. To make it up for that, I&#39;m going to make new promises :))</p>

<ul>
<li>I&#39;m going to go through the backlog of this blog and I&#39;m going to update/edit all of my posts</li>
<li>I&#39;m going to try to blog more often about things that I want to write about(I said I&#39;ll try)</li>
</ul>

<p>If you want me to stay true to my word, you might wanna bug my school so much that they shorten our timings. It&#39;s almost 11 AM so I&#39;m gonna go and eat breakfast. <a href="mailto:info@commecscollege.edu.pk">Spam my school</a>!</p>
