<p>I&#39;ve sent out tweets and wrote a blog post about it.</p>

<p>Yes I&#39;m talking about going to Islamabad.</p>

<p>I&#39;m going to leave in a few hours, but before I go, I thought I should share my bag pack with you.</p>

<p>Now this is not my only bag.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve got three more bags(!!).</p>

<p>This is my bag pack.</p>

<p>Let&#39;s get started now, shall we.</p>

<h2>The Bag</h2>

<p>So first of all the bag itself:</p>

<p>The bag is a Camel Mountain laptop bag which I bought from a local market here about an year ago.</p>

<p>It&#39;s in a <em>Grey-like color</em> though I&#39;d prefer <em>Black</em> to match my heart(Just kidding!{or am I?})</p>

<p>What I really like about the bag is that it&#39;s really spacious and has just the right amount of padding so the back is soft and still strong enough to carry quite some weight.</p>

<p>The bag has served me well and I&#39;m sure it will the next few years.</p>

<p>You can grab this bag for yourself from here</p>

<h2>What&#39;s inside</h2>

<p>Okay so now for the contents of the bag.</p>

<p>Normally I would stuff this blog with a lot and lot of stuff, but since I had to pack light for this trip, I only added things that I really needed.</p>

<p>Here&#39;s a list of everything:</p>

<ul>
<li>My HP 620 Notebook + Charger</li>
<li>Laptop Cooler</li>
<li>A notepad</li>
<li><strong>The Forty Rules of Love</strong> by Elif Shafak (<em>The book I&#39;m currently reading</em>)</li>
<li>Sony Earphones</li>
<li>USB to PS/2 convertor</li>
<li>VGA Display Cable</li>
<li>Mini Speakers</li>
<li>USB Sticks &amp; SD Card Reader</li>
<li>Mouse</li>
<li>USB Port Extender</li>
<li>Various Chargers for various devices</li>
</ul>

<p>The list may look long, but my bag is empty for the most part.</p>
